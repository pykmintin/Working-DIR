Inferring training objectives

Training Objectives Inference for Advisor and Prompt-Architect
Agents
Executive Summary
This report analyzes a dataset of 3,248 learning-focused conversational fragments, an
accompanying methodology report, and a reference framework of learning objectives, to
infer training and learning objectives for two agent roles: (1) an Advisor-type
conversational agent (helps users clarify goals and structure task briefs) and (2) a hightechnical prompt-architect meta-agent (designs, validates, and refines prompt
architectures and system-level reasoning). The provided files each contribute unique
insights: the fragment dataset with weights reveals cognitive patterns in advisor dialogues,
the methodology report explains how these fragments were extracted and classified, and
the reference JSON lists target learning objectives for advanced agent behavior.
Key Findings and Recommendations:
Data Insights: The corpus of 3,248 fragments captures prevalent reasoning patterns –
reflective analysis, procedural planning, descriptive statements, and minimal content –
which form the basis of advisor cognition modeling. Each fragment is tagged with a
weight (0.1–0.99) and rationale denoting its cognitive category (Reflective, Procedural,
Descriptive, Minimal). This enriched data helps identify what skills the Advisor agent is
exercising and hints at objectives the agent should learn (e.g. reflecting on
constraints, planning next steps). It also surfaces references to system-level
principles (like “prompts as production assets requiring lifecycle management”) that
align with the meta-agent’s domain.
Current Model Critique: The existing rule-based weighting model classifies fragments
by key “learning verbs” (e.g. reflect, plan, verify) into four cognitive tiers. While
straightforward and transparent, this approach may over-simplify conversational
nuance. We find it heavily skewed towards “Minimal” content (over 75% of fragments
fell in the lowest tier), indicating the heuristic might be too strict or not capturing
implicit reasoning. This raises concerns about missed signals – e.g. important principle
statements without explicit keywords were down-weighted as minimal. A critique is
that the weighting model, though consistent, might under-represent descriptive or
contextual learning content, and conflates presence of certain verbs with cognitive
importance.
Alternative Inference Approaches: A broader landscape of methods can supplement
or replace the current model. We discuss options including semantic pattern mining,
cognitive abstraction frameworks, and unsupervised clustering to derive training
objectives from conversation logs. These range from refined NLP pattern matching (to
catch learning-oriented phrases beyond a fixed verb list) to embedding-based
clustering of fragments (to discover emergent categories of advisor behavior). The
goal is to capture nuanced learning behaviors (e.g. iterative questioning,
summarization) that a simple keyword heuristic might miss. Each approach offers
trade-offs in interpretability and coverage.

Inferring training objectives

Interpretation Rubrics: We propose multiple contrasting rubrics for interpreting
fragments and inferring objectives, beyond the current four-tier weight model. One
formulaic system extends the rule-based categories with multi-dimensional scoring
(e.g. separate scores for reflection vs. planning content in a single utterance). Another
rubric leverages a taxonomic framework (inspired by cognitive levels like Bloom’s
taxonomy), mapping each fragment to levels such as Knowledge (recall), Application
(procedure), Analysis (reflection), etc. A third data-driven rubric uses clustered
themes from the fragments (e.g. “clarify-goal inquiry”, “plan-step outline”, “verifycheckpoint”) as categories. We examine these systems’ pros and cons – for example,
rule-based methods are transparent but brittle, whereas clustering reveals patterns
organically but may produce less intuitive categories. The report details how each
system would function and what biases or uncertainties come with each.
Agent-Specific Objectives: By analyzing each fragment type, we infer distinct learning
objectives for the Advisor vs. the Prompt-Architect agent. For
instance, reflective fragments (e.g. “I need to understand the constraints before
deciding.”) suggest that an Advisor’s training should emphasize introspective
reasoning about user needs and assumptions, whereas a meta-agent’s training would
focus on self-evaluative reasoning about prompt designs and
constraints. Procedural fragments (e.g. “Let’s plan the next evaluation cycle.”) indicate
the Advisor should learn to guide users through structured planning, while the
prompt-architect agent should learn to design and sequence complex workflows or
experiments. We highlight such differences for all fragment categories (reflective,
procedural, descriptive, minimal), showing how each type maps to role-specific skills.
This comparative analysis ensures that training objectives are tailored to each agent’s
function: the Advisor’s objectives center on conversational guidance and clarity,
whereas the meta-agent’s objectives center on technical prompt engineering and
system oversight.
Alignment with Reference Framework: We cross-reference the inferred objectives
with the provided learning.json framework of meta-architect objectives. There is
substantial alignment: many principles extracted in the conversations directly match
the reference list (for example, the fragment “Prompts must be treated as production
assets requiring lifecycle management…” appears in the logs and corresponds to a
listed objective). This confirms that the conversation data is yielding relevant highlevel goals. However, we also identify gaps – notably, the reference objectives file
emphasizes system design principles (e.g. defense-in-depth validation, multi-model
orchestration) and says little about the conversational process skills the Advisor
needs (like clarifying user intent or summarizing trade-offs). Our analysis points out
these missing pieces and suggests extensions: for example, adding objectives
around “clarifying ambiguous requirements” or “iteratively validating understanding
with the user” to cover Advisor-centric competencies. This synthesis uncovers
opportunities to enrich the training blueprint so that it covers both the technical
meta-objectives and the interactive reasoning objectives evident in the advisor logs.

Data Gaps & Signal Enhancement: We note that certain metadata and signal layers
are absent in the current dataset, limiting the fidelity of training-signal extraction. For
instance, speaker roles in some logs are ambiguous ( unknown entries) and
conversation context isn’t explicitly marked (no labels for question vs. answer, or
which phase of the task the fragment comes from). There is also no explicit measure
of outcome success or user feedback tied to fragments, which could otherwise help
weigh which advisor behaviors are truly effective. To improve future analysis, richer
annotations should be captured: e.g. tags for dialogue act (question, instruction,
explanation), markers for conversation stage (onboarding, brainstorming,
consolidation), and links to any outcome metrics (was the user satisfied? was the
objective achieved?). Such metadata would provide stronger signals – allowing more
precise filtering of what constitutes a “learning moment” and enabling supervised
models to learn from success cases. We recommend an expansion of the logging and
extraction process to include these layers, thereby improving the quality of inferred
training objectives.
Proposed System Architecture: Finally, we propose a reusable system
architecture for ongoing inference of training objectives from future advisor and
prompt-architect logs. The design is a pipeline that ingests raw dialogue data and
produces updated training objective insights in a continuous loop. Key components
include: automated fragment extraction (with an improved semantic parser), a
classification and clustering module to categorize cognitive strategies, a mapping
engine to align or expand the objectives taxonomy (like matching emerging patterns
to known objectives or flagging new ones), and a knowledge base to store and
version the evolving objectives. The architecture supports human-in-the-loop review
for quality and integrates feedback to refine its inference rules over time. This ensures
that as the agents interact in new scenarios, the system can dynamically learn and
update what skills or knowledge the agents should be trained on. Overall, this
approach moves the training objective inference from a one-off analysis to
a sustainable, scalable process embedded in the deployment of these AI agents.
In summary, by combining data-driven analysis of advisor conversations with a structured
reference framework, we derive a comprehensive set of training objectives for both the
Advisor and the Prompt-Architect agents. We identify improvements to the current
modeling approach and lay out methods and architecture for continually refining these
objectives as more conversational data becomes available. The findings aim to guide the
development of more effective meta-agents by ensuring their training targets the
nuanced skills actually needed in practice, from high-level prompt engineering principles
down to the dialogical techniques of clarifying and reasoning with users.

advisor_learning_weights.csv – Fragment Dataset with Cognitive Weights: This

CSV contains 3,248 entries of learning-first conversational fragments extracted from
advisor dialogues. Each fragment is a short text snippet (often a single sentence or
clause) that was identified as involving a learning or reasoning process (e.g. a
statement of understanding, a plan, a check or reflection). Alongside each fragment,
the file provides:
Context identifiers: an id (traceable to the source conversation turn), speaker
role ( user or the advisor agent, sometimes named “Kimi”), turn number, and
source session (Advisor_1, Advisor_2, etc.), which help situate the fragment in the
dialogue flow.
Learning fragment text: the content of the snippet, focusing on cognitively
relevant language (for example, “Understand the user’s goals…” or “I will first
validate my understanding…”).
Weight (0.10–0.99): a numeric score representing the fragment’s relevance to
advisor reasoning, as determined by a rule-based model (higher means more
cognitively rich).
Rationale: a short label or explanation of why that weight/category was assigned
(e.g. “Reflective reasoning showing awareness or evaluation” or “Minimal learning
content detected.”).
This file is the primary data source for discovering what mental processes the advisor
engages in and at what frequency/intensity. By examining which fragments were
tagged as reflective, procedural, etc., we can infer what kinds of cognitive skills or
objectives the Advisor agent is practicing. For example, a high concentration
of reflective fragments (weight ~0.8–0.99) in the data would indicate the advisor often
engages in self-analysis or evaluation, which should be an explicit training objective
for that agent. In contrast, fragments labeled minimal suggest areas where either the
content is trivial (and maybe training should minimize such filler) or the current
detection missed deeper meaning. Overall, advisor_learning_weights.csv provides
the raw evidence of advisor cognitive behavior, which we will map into training
objectives for both the Advisor and the meta-agent.
Advisor Learning Reports.pdf – Methodology and Weighting Model Report: This

PDF report documents the data processing and rationale behind the fragment
dataset. It guides our understanding of how the fragments were extracted and
classified:

It describes the extraction methodology: conversations were parsed for
sentences containing certain “learning verbs” (like define, clarify, design, reflect,
verify, ensure, check, evaluate, plan, learn, etc.). Sentences with these keywords
were split and filtered to isolate meaningful learning-oriented statements. This
clarifies that the dataset was intentionally biased toward segments where the
advisor or user is discussing understanding, planning, or verifying – key moments
for learning. Knowing this, we interpret the fragment dataset not as random
dialogue, but as deliberately the cognitive high points of conversations.

Inferring training objectives

It details the weight assignment model: a rule-based heuristic that assigns each
fragment a weight according to four cognitive categories. Specifically, Reflective
reasoning fragments (deep insights, analysis) were given weights 0.80–
0.99, Procedural cognition (planning and execution steps) 0.55–0.79, Descriptive
observation (neutral statements or info sharing) 0.30–0.54, and Minimal
content 0.10–0.29. Example verbs for each category are listed (e.g. “reflect,
analyze” for reflective; “plan, design” for procedural) and example scored
fragments are provided (ID 1001: “I need to understand the constraints before
deciding.” → 0.93, reflective). This helps us interpret the CSV: for instance, if a
fragment was weighted 0.67, the rationale likely labeled it procedural (planningrelated). Understanding these categories is crucial for inferring training
objectives: each category corresponds to a type of cognitive skill the agent is
exhibiting. The report also notes that a rationale sentence was auto-generated
for each to explain the classification.
It includes a brief distribution analysis (expected metrics) suggesting that in an
ideal scenario, about 40% of fragments would be reflective, 35% procedural, 25%
lower (descriptive/minimal). This expectation underscores that the training focus
is on the higher-order reasoning content. In reality, our analysis found the actual
output skewed more heavily to low-weight fragments, which the report indicates
might still be under refinement (the weighting was a planned step). The
methodology report’s transparency about the process allows us to critically
evaluate the dataset and consider improvements (e.g. potential underestimation
of descriptive fragments, given only ~2% were classified as descriptive).
It outlines next steps and a planned analytical roadmap, including clustering the
fragments by semantic similarity and reviewing outliers. This hints at alternative
methods (embeddings, thematic clustering) which we take into account in our
method landscape. It also emphasizes principles like traceability and
extensibility – meaning the system was designed to be built upon. We leverage
these insights to propose our extended inference methods and system
architecture.
In summary, the PDF provides context that transforms the raw CSV data into a
meaningful story about advisor cognition. It helps us interpret what the fragment
weights signify, warns us of the model’s heuristic nature (so we remain cautious about
biases), and inspires ideas for further analysis (like using clustering or embedding
techniques beyond the initial approach).
learning.json – Reference Learning Objectives Framework: This JSON file contains
a curated list of high-level learning objectives aligned with a “master blueprint” for
the meta-architecture (likely the system that these agents operate within). Each entry
is a concise principle or practice for advanced AI system design, with references to
sources (L1, L2, etc.) indicating their provenance. Examples of objectives listed include:

“Prompts function as production assets requiring lifecycle management and
performance observability...”
“Defense-in-depth validation architecture separates user content from system
instructions”
“Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounds outputs by retrieving relevant
external knowledge”

Inferring training objectives

“Continuous performance monitoring tracks semantic drift and failure patterns”,
etc.
These objectives appear to be derived from previous learning (noted by sources L1–
L4) and cover a range of system-level and procedural best practices for complex AI
orchestration. They are especially pertinent to the Prompt-Architect meta-agent, who
would be responsible for implementing and respecting such principles in prompt
design and multi-agent workflows. This file serves as a benchmark or target for our
inference: after analyzing the conversation fragments, we want to see how the
emergent objectives (what the advisor is focusing on, what needs the meta-agent
has) align with or diverge from this list. For example, if an objective
in learning.json is “Parallel exploration of alternatives enables comparison of
methods”, we can check if the advisor’s conversation ever touched on encouraging
multiple solution paths, or if the meta-agent’s design would require that capability.
We indeed find many direct overlaps, as the user’s conversation with the advisor often
explicitly enumerated these objectives (often referencing them as L1, L2, etc.,
indicating they were consolidating such principles during the dialogue). Thus, the
JSON provides a framework to validate against: it ensures our inferred training
objectives for the two agents include established ideas (no major principle is
overlooked) and helps highlight any gaps – e.g. if the advisor logs reveal an
important skill like “clarifying requirements” which is not in learning.json , that gap
suggests an extension to the framework. In essence, learning.json ties our analysis
to the broader blueprint of what the AI agents should ultimately learn, grounding our
specific findings in the context of the system’s goals.
By interpreting each file in this way, we set the stage for analysis: the CSV gives us
empirical data on advisor behavior, the PDF gives us methodology and a lens for
evaluation, and the JSON gives us the target learning outcomes especially for the metaagent. Together, they enable a comprehensive inference of training objectives, as we
explore next.

Method Landscape
Inferring training objectives from conversational data can be approached through multiple
analytical lenses. The current project employed a rule-based semantic filtering and
weighting approach. Here, we broaden the view and outline a landscape of alternative
inference methods, each leveraging different techniques to extract meaning from
conversation logs. These methods are not mutually exclusive – they can complement each
other to build a richer understanding. Key approaches include:

Inferring training objectives

1. Enhanced Semantic Pattern Mining: This approach generalizes the current rulebased method by using more advanced NLP to detect learning-related content.
Instead of relying solely on a fixed list of “learning verbs”, we could use semantic
parsing or dependency analysis to find statements where the agent is making an
inference, drawing a conclusion, or setting a goal. For example, patterns like “I need to
[X] before [Y]” or “This will help [achieve Z]” might indicate a learning objective or
strategy being discussed even if specific verbs differ. Techniques like keyword
expansion (using synonyms or word embeddings to catch variants of “clarify”,
“ensure”, etc.) and named entity or role recognition (to detect when the agent
references its own role or the user’s goal) can improve recall of relevant fragments.
The benefit of pattern mining is transparency and alignment with human intuition
(we explicitly know what we’re looking for), but the trade-off is that it may still miss
less obvious learning moments or novel phrasing. It requires iterative tuning of
patterns to improve coverage.
2. Clustering and Embedding-Based Inference: Unsupervised learning techniques
can reveal structure in the conversational fragments without predefined categories.
By converting each fragment into a vector (using language model embeddings), we
can apply thematic clustering to group similar fragments together (as hinted in the
analytical roadmap). For example, clusters might naturally form around “asking
clarifying questions”, “laying out step-by-step plans”, “discussing system
constraints”, “summarizing past results”, etc. Once clusters are formed, we interpret
each cluster to infer the underlying training objective. If one cluster consists of
fragments like “Let’s break this task down…”, “First, we should do X then Y”, that clearly
points to an objective around procedural planning skill. Another cluster might
feature self-checks (e.g. “I want to double-check that I understand…”) indicating a selfvalidation or reflection objective. Clustering is powerful in that it can
surface emergent patterns that were not explicitly looked for. It also helps handle the
nuance of multi-faceted utterances (some fragments might belong to two themes).
The trade-off is interpretability: clusters need to be manually labeled or characterized,
which can be subjective. Also, very context-dependent phrases might cluster oddly if
vector representations aren’t distinct. Nonetheless, this data-driven method ensures
we don’t narrowly focus only on what we expect – it may discover, say, a cluster of
“meta” comments (agent talking about its own limitations) that could highlight a
training need (e.g. calibrating confidence or deferring when unsure).

Inferring training objectives

3. Abstraction via Cognitive Frameworks: This method involves mapping fragments
to an existing theoretical framework of cognitive or conversational skills. For example,
using Bloom’s Taxonomy, we could classify each statement into levels such
as Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create. An advisor saying “I need
to understand the constraints…” is at the Analysis/Evaluation level (identifying what
needs evaluation), whereas “Let’s plan the next steps” is Application (applying
knowledge to a plan), and a simple factual statement would be
Remember/Understand. Similarly, one could use a framework like dialogue acts or
conversational functions: classify whether a fragment is a question, an instruction, a
confirmation, a reflection, a suggestion, etc. Each category corresponds to a skill
(e.g., asking clarification questions is a skill; giving suggestions with rationale is
another). By abstracting fragments into such categories, we can formulate training
objectives more systematically: e.g., “The Advisor should be able to Evaluate and
Analyze user needs (Bloom level V)” or “The agent should master the dialogue act of
Clarification Queries”. The benefit of a framework-based approach is that it draws on
established educational or linguistic theory, potentially covering the full range of
cognitive processes. It ensures completeness (we check each level or category for
representation in the data). The downside is that real conversational data may not fit
neatly into one taxonomy; some fragments can span multiple categories, and some
categories might not appear at all. There is also a risk of being too high-level – the
mapping might gloss over domain-specific nuance (e.g., “Evaluate” could mean
evaluating a design vs. evaluating understanding – very different in practice).
4. Supervised Learning for Intent Classification: If we had a labeled dataset of what
each fragment’s “intent” or learning significance is, we could train a classifier
(potentially using an ML model or fine-tuned language model) to automatically
categorize new fragments. For instance, human annotators (or domain experts) could
label a subset of fragments as “Goal clarification”, “Solution brainstorming”, “Verifying
assumption”, “User instruction interpretation”, etc. A model could learn these and
then predict labels for new fragments from logs. This is essentially treating training
objective inference as a classification problem at the utterance level. The advantage
is automation and potentially high accuracy in known categories – once trained, the
model could quickly sift through large volumes of logs and flag instances of each
training-relevant category. It might also capture subtle linguistic cues that rule-based
methods miss. However, it requires an initial investment in labeling data and the
performance is only as good as the consistency of those labels. It might struggle with
edge cases or shifts in language usage over time unless continuously retrained.
Moreover, the categories must be wisely chosen to correlate with meaningful training
objectives (there’s a risk of conflating surface-level intent with deeper learning goals).

Inferring training objectives

5. Temporal or Conversational Sequence Analysis: Another angle is to look at when
and how these fragments occur in the dialogue sequence. By analyzing conversation
transcripts in sequence (not just isolated fragments), we can infer objectives related to
process and timing. For instance, if reflective fragments often appear after the user
provides new information, it suggests the agent has a pattern of summarizing or
evaluating input – a training objective could be “Agent should summarize user inputs
to confirm understanding”. If procedural planning fragments appear mostly at the
conversation outset or conclusion, it indicates how the agent frames tasks – leading
to objectives like “Agent should be able to outline a plan at the start of a task and
recap next steps at the end.” Methods to do this include sequence pattern
mining (finding common n-grams of dialogue acts) or Markov/state modeling of
conversation phases. While our current data is segmented and sorted by turn, a more
sequential analysis could reveal causal relationships – e.g., a verification question from
the agent leads to a user clarification, which leads to the agent adjusting a plan. Such
patterns highlight training needs in interactive responsiveness and adaptability. The
challenge here is needing the full dialogue context and aligning fragments with their
context, which our current fragment list only partially provides. We might need to
reconstruct or refer back to the full logs (the original JSONL) to perform this analysis.
If done, it provides a dynamic view of training objectives (not just “what skill” but
“when to use it”).
6. Knowledge Graphs and Concept Extraction: Particularly for the meta-agent’s
domain, we can extract key concepts and relations discussed in the logs (e.g. lifecycle
management, validation architecture, semantic drift, failure memory). Building a simple
knowledge graph of these concepts and seeing how the conversation connects them
can inform objectives. If the advisor spends effort linking concept A to concept B (e.g.
linking “verification burden” to “system complexity” as a principle), it suggests an
objective like “The meta-agent should learn the relationship between verification
effort and system complexity” – essentially domain knowledge that the agent should
internalize. Concept frequency and co-occurrence can signal what the important
domains of knowledge are for training. This is somewhat orthogonal to the cognitive
process view, but it’s complementary: it ensures that training objectives cover not
only how the agent should think, but what content it should know well. Techniques for
this include entity extraction and topic modeling. The drawback is that not every
concept mentioned needs to become a training objective; we must filter to those
relevant to agent performance. Also, focusing on concept-level could miss the
behavioral aspect of objectives.
In practice, a robust inference of training objectives would combine these approaches. For
example, one might start with pattern mining to capture obvious cases, use clustering to
find hidden themes, apply a framework to ensure completeness, and then validate with
sequence context. The methodology report itself hints at multi-step analysis (weight
distribution, then clustering, then outlier analysis), which aligns with mixing quantitative
and qualitative methods. By employing this broad toolkit, we can derive a comprehensive
set of objectives that reflect both the qualitative insights of human analysis and
the quantitative patterns present in data.

Inferring training objectives

Building on the above methods, we now propose several concrete rubric systems for
interpreting fragments and inferring training objectives. Each system provides a formulaic
way to score or categorize fragments, offering distinct perspectives. We contrast these
systems and discuss their trade-offs:
1.

Rule-Based Cognitive Scoring System (Extended): This is an evolution of the current
weighting model. It retains the intuitive four categories – Reflective, Procedural,
Descriptive, Minimal – but refines the rules for assigning scores:
We broaden the keyword set and incorporate contextual cues. For example,
beyond explicit verbs, patterns like question marks (?) could indicate a clarifying
question (reflective intent), imperative tone could indicate instruction or planning,
etc.
Introduce a multi-facet score: instead of one weight, each fragment gets a tuple
like (ReflectionScore, PlanningScore, InfoScore). For instance, “I will first validate
my understanding…” might score (0.9 Reflection, 0.5 Planning, 0.2 Info) indicating
it’s mostly reflective with some procedural aspect. The system could use simple
rules: presence of analysis verbs adds to ReflectionScore, presence of sequence
words (first, next) adds to PlanningScore, presence of factual statements adds to
InfoScore, etc.
A final composite weight could still be computed, or the facets themselves
become categories for objectives (e.g. a high ReflectionScore fragment
contributes to reflective training objective).
Trade-offs: This system is transparent and traceable – each score is based on known
rules. It’s easy to adjust (add a new rule if a certain important pattern is under-rated).
It continues to allow quick scanning of data by category. However, it might become
complex to maintain as rules multiply, and there’s risk of overlap (a fragment
triggering multiple rules). There’s also the issue of calibrating multiple scores
meaningfully. Still, it ensures no single metric oversimplifies a fragment and can
highlight multi-dimensional utterances (some statements truly do two things at once,
e.g. reflect and plan). This extended rubric would better capture nuanced advisor
behaviors while staying interpretable.

2. Data-Driven Clustering Rubric: In this system, we dispense with predetermined
categories and let clusters define the rubric. We might derive, say, 5–10 major
clusters from the fragment embeddings and then label them as categories. An
example outcome could be categories like: “Clarification Questions”, “Planning
Steps”, “Stating Principles/Knowledge”, “Meta-Reasoning (agent talks about its
process)”, “Miscellaneous/minimal”. Each new fragment can be assigned to the nearest
cluster (perhaps giving a probability or distance measure as a score of fit). The rubric
is essentially the set of cluster centroids plus a descriptive label for each.
Trade-offs: The strength here is that categories emerge from actual usage patterns,
potentially matching the reality of conversations better than arbitrary ranges. It might
reveal a category the designers hadn’t considered. For example, a cluster might
correspond to “Agent expressing uncertainty or limitations” if such fragments exist –
which could prompt a new training objective about handling uncertainty. The scoring
(distance to centroid or cluster membership probability) can indicate how typical a
fragment is for that category, which could help find outliers or new sub-categories.
On the downside, the categories might not align perfectly with conceptual training
needs; they may need interpretation. Also, clusters can change with more data or
different parameter choices, making the rubric less stable or intuitive to humans.
Essentially, it’s harder to explain to a stakeholder why a fragment got a certain label
(“the model clustered it this way” is less satisfying than “it had a ‘plan’ verb”). So this
system sacrifices some interpretability for adaptiveness and discovery. It would likely
be used in combination with human oversight – e.g., use clustering to propose rubric
categories which are then reviewed and adjusted by experts before solidifying the
rubric.
3.

Cognitive Taxonomy Rubric (Theory-Driven): Here we apply a formal educational or
cognitive framework as the rubric. For illustration, we can use Bloom’s Taxonomy
levels (Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, Evaluation) as
categories. Each fragment is categorized into one (or more) of these levels:
Knowledge/Remember: recalling facts – e.g. a fragment that just states a piece of
info or system detail (likely a descriptive observation in the original model).
Comprehension: demonstrating understanding – e.g. rephrasing the user’s
request or summarizing (the advisor often does this to confirm understanding).
Application: using knowledge in a new situation – e.g. planning a step-by-step
approach using known principles.
Analysis: breaking down information into parts, seeing relationships – e.g.
comparing alternatives, identifying a gap or constraint.
Synthesis: combining elements to form a new whole – e.g. the agent formulating
a new approach or hypothesis from various inputs (perhaps seen in later-stage
dialogues).
Evaluation: judging and critiquing – e.g. the agent evaluating the viability of a
plan or reflecting on what is good/bad about an approach.

11/14/25, 3:39 PM

Inferring training objectives

We would devise guidelines or use an LLM-based classifier to assign each fragment to
one of these (some fragments may hit multiple levels; we could choose the highest
applicable level or allow multi-label). The result is a rubric where each category
corresponds to a broad cognitive ability that should be trained. For example, if very
few fragments hit Synthesis, perhaps the advisor isn’t doing much synthesis and we
might prioritize training that skill. If many are Analysis and Evaluation, that confirms
the agent often engages at high cognitive levels, which is a good sign for an advisor
agent.
Trade-offs: The taxonomy-based rubric ensures we cover a spectrum of cognitive
complexity. It can be appealing for designing curricula (each level suggests different
training content or methods). It is also easier to communicate (“We want the agent to
achieve more evaluation-level thinking in conversations.”). However, mapping
dialogue to Bloom’s (or any generic framework) can be subjective and sometimes
forced. Conversational utterances often perform multiple functions simultaneously,
which a linear taxonomy doesn’t capture well. Also, Bloom’s was designed for learning
objectives of human learners in educational settings; using it for AI dialogue might be
metaphorical. Some categories like Knowledge vs Comprehension may be hard to
distinguish from just one line of dialogue. Therefore, while this rubric gives a highlevel overview of cognitive objectives, it might gloss over domain-specific or rolespecific nuances (e.g. Application could mean very different things for an Advisor vs a
Prompt Architect). We might need to tailor the framework (or choose a different one
like SOLO taxonomy or a conversational acts taxonomy) to better fit our domain.
4. Multi-Agent Role-Based Rubric: Given we have two distinct agent roles of interest,
another rubric system can revolve around who the fragment is relevant to. We could
label fragments (or the skills they imply) as Advisor-centric, Meta-agentcentric, or Both. For instance, when the fragment is about understanding user goals,
that’s Advisor-centric; if it’s about designing a prompt sequence, that’s Meta-agent
centric; if it’s a general principle (like “test alternatives in parallel”), it might apply to
both. This rubric isn’t so much about scoring fragments as it is about sorting the
resultant objectives. It becomes a matrix: cognitive process X agent role. Each
fragment would be placed in the matrix, like “reflective + advisor” or “procedural +
meta-agent”. We could then formulate objectives per cell.
Trade-offs: This rubric ensures we explicitly consider each agent’s perspective and
don’t assume an objective is one-size-fits-all. It’s very relevant to this task since our
goal is to produce objectives for two roles. It leverages the content we have (some
fragments are clearly advisor conversations, others describe the architect’s duties) to
separate concerns. On the downside, doing this categorization for every fragment
might be overkill – many fragments are only spoken by the advisor anyway (so
inherently advisor-centric). And for user-spoken fragments that reference the system,
interpretation is needed to decide which agent the content informs. This system is
less about discovering new categories and more about organizing by role, so it
should be used in conjunction with another content-based rubric (like one of the
above). We will effectively be doing a form of this in the Subject-Centered Objective
Inference section by discussing each fragment type for each agent, which illustrates
this rubric in practice.

Inferring training objectives

Each proposed system brings a different lens:
The Extended Rule-Based rubric is essentially an improved version of the status quo,
emphasizing interpretability and ease of implementation.
The Clustering rubric embraces a bottom-up, data-first view that can catch unknown
unknowns but may need interpretation for use in training design.
The Taxonomy rubric imposes a top-down structure that aligns with educational
theory, ensuring completeness and clarity of objectives but possibly lacking
specificity.
The Role-based rubric ensures alignment of objectives with specific agent needs,
which is crucial when multiple agent types are being trained concurrently.
In an ideal strategy, one might combine these: use clustering to find natural groupings,
then perhaps map those clusters to a taxonomy or to the four cognitive categories (to
understand their nature), and finally separate them by agent role relevance. The
combination yields a robust rubric system: for example, we identify a cluster of “clarifying
questions”, recognize it as an Analysis/Evaluation level skill (taxonomy) largely used by the
Advisor, and thus formulate a training objective “Advisor agent should be adept at
formulating clarifying questions to evaluate user requirements.” Meanwhile, another
cluster “prompt design steps” might map to Application/Synthesis and be meta-agent
relevant, yielding an objective for the prompt-architect agent.
The trade-off across all these systems is between simplicity vs. richness. A simpler rubric
(like a tweaked version of the current one) is easy to apply but might overlook subtle
training signals. A richer rubric (multi-dimensional or data-driven) captures nuance but
can be harder to operationalize or communicate. For an effective training program, it’s
often worth embracing some complexity in analysis to ensure no major learning need is
missed, then distilling the results into a clear set of objectives for implementation.

Subject-Centered Objective Inference
In this section, we translate the patterns observed in each fragment type (cognitive
category) into concrete learning objectives, and we do so for each of the two agent roles.
By examining Reflective, Procedural, Descriptive, and Minimal fragments, we infer what
each agent (Advisor vs. Prompt-Architect meta-agent) should learn or improve, and
highlight how these objectives differ given the agent’s role and responsibilities. Each
fragment type encapsulates certain cognitive behaviors:

Reflective Fragments
Reflective fragments are those where the speaker (often the advisor agent) is analyzing,
evaluating, or showing awareness of their knowledge and approach. They often include
self-referential insights or critical thinking about the task. For example, a reflective
fragment from the data was: “I need to understand the constraints before deciding.” – here
the agent explicitly recognizes a knowledge gap and the need to fill it, demonstrating
metacognitive awareness.

Inferring training objectives

Advisor Agent Objectives (Reflective): The Advisor should be trained to engage in
introspective reasoning and critical evaluation of the problem context. From
fragments like the above, a likely learning objective is: Enable the advisor to identify
what it doesn’t know and formulate strategies to gain clarity. This includes skills like:
Clarifying Uncertainties: The advisor frequently must reflect on what information
is missing or unclear (e.g., “I must clarify what 'maximally useful' means in this
context” as seen in the conversation). A training objective might be: “The advisor
will learn to pause and articulate assumptions or ambiguities in the user’s request
or the task brief, and prompt the user to resolve them.” This ensures the advisor
doesn’t proceed with false assumptions – a critical reflective practice.
Validating Understanding: Another observed behavior: “I will first validate my
understanding by asking targeted clarification questions…”. The learning objective
here: “Train the advisor to routinely summarize its understanding of the
system/task and ask the user for confirmation or clarification.” This reflective-check
skill improves alignment with user intentions.
Awareness of Role and Limits: We saw fragments like “I do not design workflows...
I am a reflection partner” which is the advisor reflecting on its own role
boundaries. An objective could be: “Advisor should internalize its role constraints
and communicate them, reflecting on what it can or cannot do.” This is reflective
self-awareness important for multi-agent coordination (knowing when to hand
off to the Architect, for example).
Critical Evaluation of Solutions: If any reflective fragment shows the agent
evaluating a potential approach (e.g. weighing pros/cons), the advisor should be
trained in basic evaluative reasoning on user-proposed ideas (e.g. “Is this
approach feasible given the constraints?”). The objective: “The advisor can critique
initial ideas or plans at a high level, identifying potential pitfalls or missing
elements.”
In summary, reflective fragments suggest the Advisor’s learning objectives should
focus on meta-reasoning capabilities: understanding when and how to reflect,
double-check, and articulate thought processes to ensure clarity and correctness in
problem framing.
Prompt-Architect Meta-Agent Objectives (Reflective): The meta-agent (which
designs and validates prompt architectures) also benefits from reflective skills, but in
a different vein. Its reflection is about the system and prompt strategy rather than
understanding user intent. Training objectives for the prompt-architect based on
reflective patterns include:
Self-Evaluation of Prompt Efficacy: The meta-agent should be able to reflect on
whether a prompt/workflow it designed is working as intended. For instance,
analogously to the advisor saying “I need to understand constraints…”, the metaagent might think “I need to understand the model’s limitations before finalizing
this prompt.” A learning objective: “Train the prompt-architect agent to critically
evaluate its prompt designs, checking if they meet the desired criteria (clarity,
safety, goal alignment) and identifying where adjustments are needed.” This
reflective check could manifest as the agent running a small test or analyzing the
prompt’s output quality (a meta-level evaluation).

Inferring training objectives

Awareness of System Principles: Many reflective fragments in the advisor logs
pertain to system principles (since the user and advisor discuss them). The metaagent should have ingrained knowledge of and reflection on those principles. For
example, an objective from learning.json is “Post-generation uncertainty
calibration is essential”. The meta-agent’s reflective objective could be: “The
agent will internalize key architectural principles (e.g., uncertainty calibration,
defense-in-depth) and reflect those in its reasoning; it will regularly cross-check
whether a solution adheres to these principles.” Essentially, it needs to be a selfaware architect that doesn’t just generate prompts blindly but cross-references
best practices in real-time.
Failure Analysis: If something goes wrong (prompt fails or output is poor), a
meta-agent should reflect on why. This parallels an advisor reflecting on a
misunderstanding. Training objective: “Enable the meta-agent to diagnose failures
or suboptimal results by reflecting on which part of the prompt sequence might
have caused the issue (e.g., was context insufficient? was the instruction
misunderstood by the model?), and learn from it.” In practice, this might involve
the meta-agent simulating or analyzing prior prompts (perhaps using a
technique akin to “critique loops” or having an internal critic model).
Continuous Improvement Mindset: A more general reflective objective is
fostering a habit of continuous improvement. The meta-agent should be trained
to ask itself after each task: “How could this prompt or workflow be improved
further?” just as a human engineer would. This could involve keeping track of
lessons (akin to the “failure memory” concept in learning.json). An explicit
training goal: “The prompt-architect will log and recall previous mistakes or
adjustments (a ‘prompt memory’), reflecting on them to refine future prompt
iterations.”
In essence, reflective fragments translate to the meta-agent needing strong metacognitive and analytical skills about its own domain (prompts and system behavior). It
should emulate a thoughtful engineer: always checking assumptions, reviewing
outcomes, and aligning with overarching principles.

Procedural Fragments
Procedural fragments are action-oriented, focusing on planning, step-by-step methods, or
execution of tasks. For example: “Let’s plan the next evaluation cycle.” or “I will help the user
articulate what the Meta Architect needs…” (a plan to guide the user). These indicate goaldirected behavior sequences.
Advisor Agent Objectives (Procedural): For the Advisor, procedural fragments
indicate the agent’s role in guiding process and structure during the conversation.
Training objectives include:

Inferring training objectives

Task Structuring: The advisor often has to help break down a complex goal into
manageable parts or outline a brief. An observed fragment: “project stages…
Provide structured, high-signal thinking… Transform messy user intention into clear
inputs” (though that one was oddly marked minimal due to being a list, it
contains procedural intent). Objective: “Train the advisor to co-create a structured
plan or outline with the user for any given high-level task.” This means if a user
goal is vague, the advisor can propose a step-by-step approach or a checklist of
what needs to be done first, second, etc. It’s essentially project scoping and
planning in conversational form.
Guiding the User Through Workflow: The advisor might lead the user through
interactive steps. For instance, “Let’s go through this example” or “First, we’ll clarify
requirements, then we’ll brainstorm solutions, finally we’ll refine the best
idea.” Even if not verbatim in our fragments, this style is implied. So an
objective: “Advisor should learn to guide the user through a logical sequence of
steps (clarification -> ideation -> evaluation -> conclusion) depending on the task
context.” This ensures consistency and thoroughness in how the advisor assists.
Ensuring Procedural Completeness: One fragment shows “This step ensures
accuracy.” – presumably the agent commenting on why a step is needed. That
implies an objective: “The advisor will learn to not only suggest steps but also
explain the purpose of each step, ensuring the user understands why the process is
structured that way.” This builds user trust and clarity in the process.
Adapting Procedures to User Needs: The advisor should also be procedural in a
flexible way – adapting the plan if the user’s situation changes. For example, if
mid-conversation new info comes, the advisor might say “Given this new
information, let’s adjust our plan.” A training goal could be: “Ability to dynamically
update the task structure or next steps in response to new context or user feedback.”
Time/Resource Awareness: Though not explicitly in fragments, an advisor might
need procedural awareness of constraints (time, tools available). For
instance, “We have X minutes, so I suggest doing Y first.” If any fragment indicated
managing scope, that yields an objective around procedural prioritization.
Prompt-Architect Meta-Agent Objectives (Procedural): For the meta-agent,
procedural fragments inform objectives about designing and executing multi-step
prompt workflows or validation processes:
Workflow Design: The meta-agent’s core job is designing prompt sequences and
experiments. A direct training objective is: “Enable the meta-agent to plan multistep prompting strategies to accomplish complex tasks.” For example, if solving a
problem requires a chain of prompts (e.g., one to gather requirements, one to
generate candidates, one to evaluate candidates), the agent should be trained to
outline and implement that sequence. This is analogous to the advisor’s task
structuring but at a more technical level (structuring the interaction with the
model(s) and tools).

Inferring training objectives

Procedural Validation Loops: Many principles in learning.json highlight
validation, e.g. “Defense-in-depth validation architecture”, “Multi-stage alignment
loops”, “verification loops”. The meta-agent should be trained to follow
procedural validation and verification steps for any output. So an objective: “The
prompt-architect agent will incorporate multiple validation checkpoints in its
workflows (such as intermediate verifications of output correctness, consistency
checks, etc.), rather than producing a single-step answer.” Essentially, it learns to
design a procedure around generation (like generate -> critique -> refine).
Tool Orchestration: If the meta-agent has access to tools or multiple models (as
hints of multi-model orchestration suggest), an objective is: “Learn to
procedurally orchestrate different models or modules (e.g., a generator and a critic,
a retriever and a composer) in a structured manner to leverage their strengths.” For
example, the agent might plan: call Model A to retrieve info, then Model B to
draft an answer, then Model C to review the answer. This is a complex procedure
the agent must execute reliably.
Reusability and Modularity: A more abstract procedural skill is designing
prompts in a modular way so they can be reused or updated (connected
to “Prompts as production assets” principle). Training objective: “Teach the metaagent to create and maintain prompts as reusable modules, with version control
and iterative improvement – effectively, treat prompt design itself as a procedural
craft.” For example, it might maintain a library of tested prompt components and
assemble them as needed (very much a procedure of reuse).
Efficiency and Optimization: The meta-agent should also learn procedures for
optimizing performance – e.g., caching intermediate results, doing parallel
prompt explorations (as one principle suggests “Parallel exploration of
alternatives”). So an objective could be: “Train the agent in procedural
optimization techniques, like caching, parallel branching, and token budget
management, to ensure efficient prompt execution.” These are procedural in the
sense of following a certain method to save resources.
In summary, procedural fragments emphasize planning and execution skills. The Advisor’s
objectives center on guiding the human through a clear process, while the meta-agent’s
focus on designing and following multi-step prompt workflows and validation processes.
Both share the need to be systematic and methodical, but the content of their procedures
differs (human-centric process vs. AI system-centric process).

Descriptive Fragments
Descriptive fragments involve stating facts, observations, or explaining something without
explicitly driving action or reflection. They often provide context or share information. For
example: “Explains why failure memory exceeds success memory,” (a fragment likely
summarizing a concept), or “UI affordances must match task types” (stating a principle).
These are more informational in nature.
Advisor Agent Objectives (Descriptive): For the Advisor, descriptive moments in
conversation usually mean the agent is conveying information or summarizing
knowledge for the user’s benefit. Training objectives derived from this could include:

Inferring training objectives

Effective Summarization: The advisor often has to summarize the current system,
the blueprint, or prior results for the user. For instance, Kimi’s output might
include summarizing the system context (“My Understanding of the System…”
which spans multiple fragments). An objective: “Train the advisor to succinctly
summarize relevant background information or prior discussions in a way the user
can easily grasp.” This is a key skill especially if users come in with partial
information or if the conversation is long and the advisor needs to recap.
Clarity in Explanations: When explaining a concept (like what “failure memory” is
or why a principle matters), the advisor should do so clearly and accurately. An
objective: “The advisor should be able to explain technical concepts or design
principles (from the system’s blueprint) to the user in clear, layman-understandable
language when needed.” Essentially, the advisor acts as a translator between
complex system details and the user’s understanding. If the logs show the user
was sometimes confused, the advisor’s descriptive ability could be improved.
Highlighting Key Details: If a fragment is descriptive, e.g. “This module tests
whether the system can guide prompt design” (paraphrasing a fragment about a
test), the advisor is providing an observation. A training objective can be: “Teach
the advisor to pick out and verbalize key details or observations about the current
task state or output.” For example, if the user gets a draft output, the advisor
might highlight a critical part: “Notice that the second section addresses X, which
was a key requirement.”
Contextual Knowledge Integration: Some descriptive fragments might be the
advisor bringing in external knowledge (if allowed) or reminding of something
previously stated (“The blueprint I envision is a master design document…” is a
user statement being descriptive). If the advisor can incorporate known info (like
definitions of terms or relevant examples) at the right time, that’s useful. So an
objective: “Enable the advisor to inject relevant contextual knowledge or definitions
to assist the user’s understanding (without derailing the conversation).”
Overall, descriptive fragments for the Advisor highlight the role of the advisor as
a knowledge conduit – it should have enough understanding and articulation to
inform the user without necessarily solving the problem itself. Training should ensure
the advisor can communicate information effectively and knows when to provide
factual input.
Prompt-Architect Meta-Agent Objectives (Descriptive): For the meta-agent,
descriptive content often relates to documenting or explaining the system’s behavior or
design decisions. Potential objectives:
State Reporting: The meta-agent might need to report on the current state of a
workflow or the outcome of a step (like logging). For instance, after running part
of a prompt sequence, it might produce a description: “Step 1 completed,
retrieved 5 relevant articles.” A training objective: “Teach the meta-agent to
generate clear descriptions of intermediate results and system state changes as it
executes a prompt architecture.” This keeps any human overseer or linked agents
informed (and is analogous to how the advisor explains things to a user, but the
meta-agent might explain to logs or to a monitoring system).

Inferring training objectives

Documentation and Justification: Many learning.json objectives read like
documentation of design principles. The meta-agent should arguably be able to
justify its own design choices in similar descriptive terms. Objective: “The promptarchitect agent will be able to articulate the rationale behind its prompt designs or
architectural decisions in descriptive terms (e.g. ‘Because prompts are treated as
production assets, I have versioned this prompt with comments…’).” This could help
in audits or collaboration with human developers.
Knowledge Base Population: If the system includes a knowledge base of verified
outputs or principles (as suggested by “Semantic knowledge bases store verified
outputs”), the meta-agent might contribute to it by writing descriptions of new
learnings or results. Training objective: “Enable the agent to summarize and record
new insights or verified outcomes into a knowledge repository in a concise
descriptive format.” Essentially, it needs to do the “paperwork” of learning –
describing what was learned for future reference.
Interpreting User Objectives in System Terms: When the advisor passes a wellstructured input to the meta-agent, the meta-agent must interpret it (which
might involve re-stating it in internal terms). A descriptive skill here is: “The metaagent can take a user-level goal description and restate it as an internal objective
or set of specifications for the system.” This translation is partly procedural, partly
descriptive (it’s explaining the user’s need in system language). The training
objective: “Prompt-architect is able to expand or clarify user requests into technical
specifications (e.g. listing requirements or criteria the solution must meet).” We
glean this because often the advisor’s output (System Initialization Brief or
learning objectives) might be consumed by the meta-agent, who then has to
understand them fully.
In short, descriptive capabilities for the meta-agent revolve around communication
and recording within the system’s context. The meta-agent may not have a human user
to explain things to in real-time (if it’s an autonomous back-end agent), but it still
benefits from being able to describe its process and decisions for transparency,
debugging, and knowledge retention.

Minimal Fragments
Minimal fragments were classified as having little explicit learning content (weights ~0.1–
0.29). They might be fragments that are very short, generic, or context-setting without an
obvious cognitive action. For example: “Your job is to …” (instruction prefix), or “related
roles (Designer, Auditor, etc” (partial phrase), or even just connectors. These often got
labeled "Minimal learning content detected.". While individually not insightful, in
aggregate they provide context or structure to the conversation.
Advisor Agent Objectives (Minimal content): For the Advisor, minimal fragments
might correspond to housekeeping utterances or fragments of instructions. The
learning value is low per fragment, but patterns might still inform objectives:

Inferring training objectives

Reduce Filler and Off-Task Content: If the advisor sometimes produces chatty
filler or irrelevant statements, an objective would be to minimize that. E.g., if an
advisor response started with “Sure, I can help with that.” (which might be
considered minimal content if not followed by substance), training should aim for
more substantive contributions. Objective: “Train the advisor to maximize
informational content in each turn, avoiding empty polite responses or repetitions
that don’t advance the task.” (Of course politeness is good, but from a learning
perspective, we want high signal.)
Context Bridging: Some minimal fragments might be things like segment titles
or transitions (like “STEP 3 CROSS MODEL COVERAGE MAP” which looks like a
header). While these are not learning-rich alone, the objective could be making
sure the advisor can context switch or introduce new sections clearly.
Perhaps: “The advisor should be able to clearly indicate conversation structure or
next section (e.g. ‘Now, let's discuss X…’) without overloading content.” Essentially,
minimal content sometimes is just structural glue in conversation, which is fine,
but it should be purposeful.
Accurate Role Acknowledgment: If minimal fragments include things like the
advisor stating role constraints (“You are a reflection partner, an input structuring
expert” pieces, some of which were low-weight fragments), an objective might be
to ensure the advisor always maintains its role. E.g., it should explicitly not do
tasks outside its scope. Actually one fragment: “You do not execute the tasks of the
Architect... You are a reflection partner” was marked reflective with 0.98 (likely
because of the phrasing “You are a reflection partner”). But surrounding lines
splitting that instruction might be minimal. The objective here is more like a
rule: “The advisor must consistently stay in its advisory role and refrain from
performing actions reserved for other agents.” This is gleaned from the fact that
the initialization prompt hammered those points (though we categorize it
minimal, the instruction itself is critical).
Following Conversation Protocols: Minimal content may include
acknowledgments or short answers. The advisor should still handle those
properly – e.g., saying “Yes, got it.” when appropriate, or providing a short
confirmation. Training might include dialogue etiquette objectives like giving
confirmations or asking for pause when needed. These aren’t “learning
objectives” in the cognitive sense, but are part of training the conversational
ability of the advisor (like social/pragmatic competence).
Prompt-Architect Meta-Agent Objectives (Minimal content): For the meta-agent,
minimal fragments from the logs might correspond to system messages,
placeholders, or partial references. In the conversation, a lot of minimal fragments
were actually the user’s references to sources (like “[Source: L1, L2]”) or half-sentences
broken by segmentation. In terms of meta-agent training:

Inferring training objectives

Handle System Instructions & Metadata: The meta-agent should learn to handle
pieces of input that are not full instructions but meta-instructions. For instance, if
the advisor or system feed includes labels, the meta-agent must not get
confused. A possible training objective: “Teach the prompt-architect to recognize
and ignore or appropriately process non-content tokens, placeholders, or system
tags in its input.” This comes from seeing those bracketed [Source] references
which a naive agent might try to interpret literally.
Integration of Minor Signals: If minimal content fragments include small hints
(like a user saying “e.g., ...” or an incomplete sentence), the meta-agent should
not drop them if they matter. So an objective could be: “Ensure the meta-agent
can integrate minor context clues (like partial examples, or titles of steps) into its
understanding of the task.” For example, if the advisor output had a structure with
headings, the meta-agent should interpret the headings appropriately even if
they carry no verb.
Efficient Parsing: The meta-agent likely will parse inputs that might include some
noise or extraneous content. Training objective: “The meta-agent will robustly
parse input prompts or briefs, filtering out non-essential verbiage while capturing
essential details.” This essentially means not being thrown off by irrelevant or
minimal bits.
Avoid Unnecessary Verbosity: On the output side, the meta-agent should be
trained not to generate excessive minimal content. For instance, if it’s producing
a prompt sequence, it shouldn’t produce a lot of boilerplate text. It should be
succinct and focused – something like an objective of “Minimize superfluous
content in designed prompts or system messages to keep them efficient.”
While minimal fragments by definition carry low direct learning content, analyzing them
ensures that our training objectives don’t ignore the “glue” that holds interactions
together. For the Advisor, it’s about maintaining role and structure without fluff; for the
meta-agent, it’s about dealing with or producing formal/structural content correctly. Both
agents should learn to reduce noise and focus on signal in their respective contexts.

Synthesis of Fragment-Type Objectives
Combining the above for each fragment category, we can see a clear divergence in focus
between the two agent types:
The Advisor’s objectives emphasize interactive reasoning skills: reflecting to
understand the user and task, guiding the process, explaining concepts clearly, and
structuring the conversation effectively. The advisor is the facilitator of human
thought – so its training revolves around communication, clarification, and high-level
planning in dialog.
The Prompt-Architect’s objectives emphasize technical reasoning and design skills:
reflecting on prompt and system issues, planning multi-step prompt solutions,
ensuring thorough validation and integration of principles, describing and
documenting processes. The meta-agent is the orchestrator of AI workflows – so its
training focuses on designing effective prompts, maintaining system integrity
(through principles like those in learning.json), and self-improvement loops.

Inferring training objectives

Even where both agents share a fragment type (e.g., both have to “reflect”), the content
and purpose of that reflection differ. We’ve highlighted those differences in each
category. This ensures that each agent’s training curriculum can be specialized: the
Advisor is trained in “people-facing” cognitive competencies, and the Prompt-Architect in
“system-facing” cognitive competencies – a necessary distinction to fulfill their
complementary roles.

Synthesis with learning.json
Now we compare the inferred objectives from our analysis with the reference learning
objectives provided in learning.json . The goal is to identify where they match (i.e., our
analysis independently arrived at similar objectives, confirming their importance), where
there are gaps (objectives present in the logs/our inference but not explicitly in the
reference, or vice versa), and potential extensions to the framework (new objectives to
add, or ways to broaden existing ones).
Matches (Alignment with Existing Objectives):
It was heartening to find that many high-level principles discussed in the advisor
conversations align directly with the learning.json objectives. For example:
Prompts as Lifecycle-Managed Assets: Both the conversation fragments
and learning.json stress that prompts are not one-off queries but enduring artifacts
that require maintenance. We saw multiple fragments where the user (or advisor)
notes “Prompts must be treated as production assets requiring lifecycle management…”,
which corresponds exactly to a listed objective. Our training objective inference for
the meta-agent included learning version control and iterative improvement of
prompts, which echoes this point.
Defense-in-Depth Validation: The idea that user content should be isolated from
system instructions for security (and generally having layered validation) is explicitly
in learning.json and was repeatedly referenced in the conversation (fragments
about “validation architecture separates user content from system instructions” appear
in the logs). We included training for the meta-agent to implement multi-layer
validation steps, aligning with this.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): The reference lists RAG grounding outputs
with external knowledge. In the conversation data, terms like “RAG grounding”
showed up when enumerating principles. While our focus was more on the process, a
likely training objective for the meta-agent (not explicitly stated earlier but implied) is
to incorporate retrieval steps when needed. The presence of this in both the reference
and logs suggests the meta-agent training must include knowledge of when/how to
use retrieval.

Inferring training objectives

Continuous Monitoring and Feedback Loops: learning.json contains objectives
like “Continuous performance monitoring tracks semantic drift” and “Multi-stage
alignment loops integrate human preferences and constitutional constraints”. The
advisor’s conversation indeed involved multi-stage refinement of learning objectives
(with user critiques and revisions – a human-in-loop alignment process). Our inferred
objective for the meta-agent to have iterative improvement and failure analysis aligns
with the idea of continuous monitoring and adjustment. Similarly, we talked about
the advisor validating understanding continually, which is a micro-level feedback
loop. So the concept of ongoing checks and refinements is well represented in both.
Parallel and Multi-Model Approaches: The reference mentions “Parallel exploration
of alternatives” and “Multi-model orchestration”. In the conversation logs, we saw
references to parallel exploration, and mention of multiple roles and models (Kimi
was aware of a family of roles, implying multiple agents/models). Our proposed
training objectives for the meta-agent included orchestrating multiple models and
possibly parallel prompting to compare results. This is a direct match with the
blueprint’s vision for a sophisticated meta-agent.
Result Reuse and Efficiency: One objective in JSON is “Result reuse optimizes cognitive
workload by avoiding redundant verification…”. In conversation, the user and advisor
discussed caching and reusing outputs (e.g., the principle “Multi level caching
optimizes cost” was mentioned). We incorporated the idea of caching and not redoing
work in the meta-agent’s procedural skills. This indicates alignment on efficiencyfocused objectives.
Verification Burden & Manual Signals: The reference emphasizes “Verification burden
is the primary constraint” and “Manual verification actions are stronger training
signals”. The logs contained instances of discussing verification steps and how to
involve manual checks (the user was actively verifying principles). Our analysis did
factor in the advisor guiding verification and the meta-agent building it into
workflows. This alignment suggests our inferred objectives duly emphasize
verification, consistent with the known framework.
Cognitive Overhead and Safety: Finally, learning.json has items like “Cognitive
overhead minimization improves verification consistency” and “Constitutional rules
require periodic re-derivation”. The advisor’s job in conversation was partially to
reduce cognitive load on the user by structuring information (which is cognitive
overhead management). We also saw the advisor mention the blueprint evolving and
needing to update understanding (which touches on re-derivation of rules when the
blueprint changes). So our advisor objectives around structuring and clarifying help
with overhead, and meta-agent reflective objective about periodically re-checking
core rules aligns with re-derivation. These subtle points show up in both, confirming
their importance.

Inferring training objectives

In summary, there is a strong correspondence between the high-level system design
objectives in learning.json and the needs we identified for the prompt-architect agent.
Many of the technical and architectural objectives we inferred (like layered validation,
prompt versioning, orchestration, etc.) are explicitly in the reference list, which is
reassuring – it means the training objectives we’re formulating for the meta-agent are
grounded in the intended system blueprint. Similarly, some of the advisor’s behaviors
(continuous clarification, summarizing to reduce confusion) indirectly support those same
principles (ensuring alignment, minimizing misunderstanding which is akin to minimizing
drift).
Gaps and Differences:
However, there are notable areas where our analysis (especially on the Advisor side)
extends beyond or differs from the current learning.json objectives. These gaps highlight
opportunities for expansion:
Advisor Conversational Skills vs. Technical Objectives: The learning.json entries skew
towards system-level and technical considerations (prompt engineering, validation,
architecture). They do not explicitly cover the conversational strategies that an Advisor
agent needs. For instance, nowhere in the JSON does it say “Clarify user
requirements” or “Ask targeted questions to verify understanding” – yet these were
clearly vital in the advisor’s dialogues and hence in our inferred objectives. This is a
gap: the framework might need additional objectives related to interactive clarity
and user guidance. These could be framed as: “Ensure thorough requirement
clarification before solution design” or “Employ reflective listening to confirm
understanding” as general principles. Currently, the blueprint might assume an advisor
does this, but it’s not enumerated as a learning objective for the system. We’d
recommend adding something along those lines to capture the training focus for
advisors.
Human-Agent Interaction Objectives: Similarly, the reference objectives don’t
mention user experience or how the agent should interact with humans (they are
mostly about internal workings). Our analysis touched on things like the advisor
explaining clearly, minimizing filler, etc. These could be formulated as objectives
like “Communication clarity and completeness” or “User guidance and education”. In a
holistic training blueprint, you’d want a section on conversational etiquette or
effectiveness. This is currently a gap.

Inferring training objectives

Meta-Agent Self-Management: Another gap is that learning.json lists principles
but doesn’t explicitly say the meta-agent should learn them – it assumes these are
guiding truths. We extrapolated to training objectives like the agent reflecting on
those principles, documenting decisions, etc. The gap here is subtle: the blueprint lists
what should be done (prompts should be versioned, etc.), but not necessarily as
learning objectives phrased for an agent. We might reframe some of them as
actionable objectives. For example, instead of just stating the principle, an objective
could be “The meta-agent consistently applies lifecycle management to prompt assets,
including version control and performance tracking”. Many objectives in JSON start
with nouns (“Prompts function as…”, “Retrieval-Augmented Generation grounds…”),
whereas training objectives for an agent could be phrased as capabilities or behaviors
(“Agent treats prompts as assets with lifecycle management”; “Agent can utilize RAG
to ground answers”). Ensuring each principle is translated into an agent behavior
might be an extension needed.
Missing Principles Not in Conversation: Conversely, there might be objectives in
learning.json that did not prominently feature in the observed conversation. For
example, “Four-layer architecture: constitutional shielding, heuristic routing, critique
loops, semantic knowledge bases” is one listed objective. In the advisor logs, pieces of
that appear (they mention four-layer architecture vaguely in an “only mine” list), but
the advisor wasn’t directly dealing with implementing a four-layer architecture – that’s
more a design blueprint. Our training objectives for the meta-agent didn’t explicitly
mention “implement four-layer architecture” (that’s more of a system design than a
single agent skill). This could be a gap: if the meta-agent is responsible for such an
architecture, maybe training should include understanding the layers and interacting
with them properly. Perhaps the meta-agent needs to be aware of which layer it is
operating in or coordinate with those layers (if they correspond to different
subsystems or policies). This suggests an objective like “The meta-agent will interface
correctly with each layer of the system (ensuring constitutional rules are checked,
routing is respected, critique feedback is incorporated, knowledge base is updated)”. It’s
an area not explicitly covered in our earlier inference but worth noting if the metaagent is in charge of that architecture.
Agent Wellness and Sustainability: One intriguing objective in JSON is “Sustainability
requires interaction thresholds and rest periods”. This implies concerns about the
agent’s operational health or avoiding overuse (maybe to prevent degraded
performance or high cost). This did not come up in the conversation with the advisor
(understandably, since that’s more of a system ops consideration). Our analysis
similarly didn’t cover training the agent to throttle itself or take breaks. If the metaagent runs continuously, it might need logic to avoid spamming an API or exhausting
resources. That objective is a bit meta – possibly an operational guideline rather than
something an AI “learns”. However, to align, we could incorporate that as a training
point: e.g. the meta-agent should be aware of not exceeding certain usage limits and
perhaps escalate or pause if thresholds are hit. It’s a niche point, but it’s in the
blueprint, so we highlight it as an area our inference hadn’t touched (gap from our
side).

Inferring training objectives

Opportunity: Unifying Advisor and Meta-agent Objectives: The synergy between
what the advisor helps produce (the consolidated learning objectives L1–L4) and what
the meta-agent consumes begs an objective around inter-agent collaboration. For
example, “Tagging reveals actual behavioral priorities” might refer to analyzing
conversation logs (tagging them) to see what was actually prioritized – something a
training pipeline might do. The conversation logs themselves are a form of tagging
(with weights). There might be an opportunity to explicitly include an objective about
learning from the advisor’s outputs. Perhaps: “The meta-agent leverages advisorgenerated insights (like identified ambiguities or consolidated objectives) to adjust its
planning.” While not in JSON, this is an extension that ensures the chain from advisor
to architect is closed. It’s implied by having an advisor at all, but making it a training
objective means the meta-agent is tested on using advisor input effectively.
Extensions and Additions:
Based on the above gaps, we can suggest extending the learning objectives framework:
Conversational Mastery Objectives: Add objectives targeted at the Advisor role, such
as “Employ iterative querying to refine user goals”, “Provide structured summaries of
complex information”, “Maintain role boundaries while maximizing helpful input”, etc.
These could complement the existing technical objectives by addressing the humanfacing side.
Agent Collaboration Objectives: Perhaps objectives about how different agents or
roles interact. E.g., “Downstream agents (Designer, Architect) effectively utilize Advisor’s
structured outputs” and conversely “Advisor anticipates the needs of downstream
agents in its outputs”. This two-way objective would formalize the relationship seen in
logs where the advisor is explicitly trying to make outputs “maximally useful” for the
Meta-Architect.
Refinement of Existing Phrasing: Ensure each learning.json objective can be
expressed as a capability for training. We partially did that in our inferred objectives.
For instance, where JSON says “Parallel exploration... enables comparison”, we could
add “The meta-agent can spawn and manage parallel solution branches and compare
outcomes to choose the best approach.” This makes it actionable.
Missing content from logs to objectives: The advisor logs had some unique terms
(e.g., “emoji routers”, “tri verifier pattern” in the fragments). These might be highly
specific and not in JSON. If they are considered important, they might become new
objectives. For example, “tri verifier pattern” might refer to using three verifiers for
something – that could turn into an objective about redundancy in verification.
Without outside context it’s hard to say, but the presence of jargon in logs that isn’t
in JSON implies either those were experimental ideas or not consolidated. If they are
valuable, they’d be an extension to incorporate.
User-Centered Outcomes: One perspective not in JSON is measuring success in terms
of user satisfaction or task success. Training objectives could include “maximize user’s
clarity and satisfaction by end of advisor interaction” or “meta-agent solutions meet
defined user success criteria”. These are more outcome metrics than design principles,
but tying objectives to user outcomes can strengthen the training alignment with
actual needs. This extension goes slightly beyond internal operation to external effect.

Inferring training objectives

In conclusion, the learning.json provided a robust set of objectives, mainly oriented to
the meta-agent’s technical domain, and our analysis both confirms many of those and
complements them with advisor-oriented and interaction-oriented objectives. The
matches reassure us that the agent training will incorporate critical system design
principles, while the gaps show where we should broaden the training curriculum to fully
encompass the advisor’s role and ensure the meta-agent doesn’t just follow principles in
isolation but also interacts well in the multi-agent ecosystem. By filling these gaps –
adding conversational objectives and refining agent collaboration aspects – the
framework of learning objectives can be made truly comprehensive, covering everything
from low-level dialogue tactics to high-level architectural strategy.

Missing Data & Future Improvements
Analyzing the current dataset and methodology revealed several limitations in the
available data and signals. Addressing these would significantly improve the extraction of
meaningful training signals and the accuracy of objective inference. Here we identify
the missing metadata and signal layers that, if added, would enhance future analyses:
Full Dialogue Context and Segmentation: The fragments
in advisor_learning_weights.csv are isolated sentences or clauses extracted from
their dialogue context. While useful for pinpointing cognitive acts, this loses the
surrounding conversation that gives each fragment meaning (who said what before,
and what happened after). For deeper analysis (e.g., sequence patterns or causeeffect of questions and answers), we need the full turn-by-turn dialogue. An
improvement is to retain references or metadata linking each fragment to the
preceding and following utterances in the conversation. This could be as simple as
including a conversation turn ID and an index of the fragment within that turn. With
that, one could reconstruct threads or at least reason about whether a fragment was
an opening question, a mid-conversation reflection, or a concluding
summary. Having context windows around each fragment as part of the data would
allow training models to understand when to use that behavior. For example, an
objective “ask clarifying questions early” can only be learned if we know which
questions occurred early vs late – currently, that timing isn’t explicit in the fragment
list.
Speaker Role Consistency and Identification: We noticed entries labeled
as unknown or inconsistent casing ( User vs user , Kimi vs assistant ) in the
dataset. This indicates some role attribution issues. It’s important that each fragment
is clearly tagged with who is speaking and possibly their role type (human user,
advisor agent, or other agent). In multi-agent setups, there might be multiple AIs (the
advisor, the architect, etc.) – if their dialogues get logged, we need a way to
distinguish fragments by agent. Consistently capturing the agent identity for each
utterance is crucial. For future logs, a standardized schema (e.g., role:
advisor|architect|user|... ) would help filter relevant fragments per agent and
avoid confusion. This also helps training signals: we wouldn’t mistakenly train the
advisor on something the architect said or vice versa.

Inferring training objectives

Outcome Labels or Success Metrics: The current data doesn’t indicate which
conversations (or which strategies within them) led to successful outcomes (e.g., the
user was satisfied or the final objectives were high quality). If we had some metric of
success or quality for each session or fragment (even a coarse one, like “did the user
accept the advisor’s proposal? yes/no”), that could serve as a powerful training signal.
We could correlate fragment types with successful interactions. For example, maybe
sessions where the advisor asked more reflective questions ended up more successful
– that would reinforce an objective to do that. Or if certain procedural outlines
correlate with user satisfaction, we’d emphasize those. In future data gathering,
incorporating feedback signals (user ratings, whether the final solution was adopted,
etc.) would let us not just infer what agents do, but what they should do more or less
of to be effective. This moves towards reinforcement learning type signals, which are
valuable for training optimization.
Intent Annotations or Dialogue Act Tags: As discussed, one could classify each
utterance by its intent (question, instruction, confirmation, etc.). Currently, the
rationale kind of serves this purpose at a high level (reflective, procedural...), but those
are broad. A more fine-grained annotation of each fragment’s function in
conversation would allow more precise objective formulation. For instance, tagging a
fragment as “clarification question” vs “open-ended question” vs “reflection
statement” can help differentiate training scenarios. If manual annotation is costly,
even using a model to generate these tags for analysis could help. These tags
become additional features for clustering or for training supervised models to detect
when the agent is doing X or Y. They can also reveal if certain important acts are
underrepresented (maybe the advisor seldom uses a “summarizing statement” tag –
meaning we should train more on summarizing). So, having a dialogue act
layer would be beneficial.
Emotional or Sentiment Context: While not a primary focus in this technical context,
user sentiment or confusion level could be a helpful signal. If, say, the user expresses
confusion, that’s a cue for the advisor to engage a certain mode (clarify further,
simplify language). Right now, the logs likely don’t label user emotion or satisfaction
at each turn. If future data can include sentiment analysis of user responses or a
simple “user asked for re-clarification here”, we could identify which advisor behaviors
triggered confusion or resolution. This goes somewhat into UX territory, but it’s
relevant for training advisors that interact with humans to be sensitive to those cues.
Connection to Source Materials (Traceability): The methodology emphasizes
traceability – each fragment has an ID tied to source. However, we might also want to
link fragments to the knowledge source or principle they reference, if any. E.g., a
fragment that states “Prompts must be treated as production assets…” came from a
source document or user input (with [Source: L1, L2]). If we tag that fragment with
which principle it belongs to (like a principle ID from the blueprint), then we can see
how often each principle was mentioned or learned. In the data, we see those
[Source: L1] tags inside the text but not as structured data. Structuring it (like an
additional column “linked_objective_id”) would allow a very direct analysis: which
objectives are heavily discussed vs which not at all. For training, if an objective was
never mentioned, maybe the agent didn’t learn it – we might need to simulate
scenarios for it.

Inferring training objectives

Temporal Information and Turn Durations: Including timestamps or at least turn
indices might expose interesting dynamics (e.g., does the advisor take longer or
produce more fragments in early phase vs later? Did the meta-agent’s process slow
down at some complex step?). Temporal data might help with objectives like the
sustainability one (monitor how long interactions go). While not critical, it can reveal if
an agent tends to “ramble” or respond too quickly without reflection, etc. Possibly, a
future system could monitor time taken per reasoning step as a signal of complexity
or agent certainty.
Error or Correction Markers: Were there places where the advisor made a mistake
and corrected itself, or had to revise something after user feedback? If yes, marking
those would be very valuable: they highlight learning opportunities (the agent should
avoid that mistake next time or handle that differently). The current fragment list
might include the correction as just another fragment (maybe reflective “Okay, let's
adjust since X was wrong”), but we wouldn’t know it was a correction unless reading
full context. Explicitly labeling corrections or missteps in logs could help target
objectives around error handling and recovery.
User Profile or Task Type Metadata: If applicable, knowing what kind of user or what
category of task each session was could allow tailoring objectives. For example, if
some tasks are design tasks vs troubleshooting tasks, the advisor might need slightly
different approaches. Our analysis was generic, but in future, classifying conversations
by scenario and seeing which objectives matter per scenario could refine training
(e.g., maybe in troubleshooting, verifying assumptions is key, whereas in
brainstorming, encouraging creativity might be a new objective). So, adding a “task
type” label to each conversation or even a brief description of the goal could
contextualize the fragments.
To summarize, enhancing the dataset with richer annotations and metadata will improve
the fidelity of any automated inference:
We need context to understand sequence and causality.
Clear speaker roles to separate agent behaviors.
Success/failure signals to focus training on what works.
Fine-grained tags for utterance function and content to allow targeted objective
mining.
Trace links to source principles to measure coverage.
Possibly additional layers like sentiment or error flags to incorporate human reaction.
By addressing these missing pieces in future data collection (for instance, designing the
logging system for the agents to output structured event logs, or performing post-hoc
annotation of dialogues), we will get a more multi-dimensional view of the conversation.
That in turn leads to more accurate and comprehensive training objectives. Essentially, the
more we know about each fragment’s role and effect, the better we can translate it into
what the agent should learn from it.

Reusable System Architecture

Inferring training objectives

Finally, we propose a reusable system architecture for continuously inferring training
objectives from future advisor and prompt-architect logs. The idea is to create an end-toend pipeline that can take raw conversational data from these agents’ interactions and
output an updated set of learning objectives or insights, in a repeatable and scalable
manner. Such a system ensures that as the agents are used (and conversations
accumulate), the training objectives can evolve and stay aligned with actual usage patterns
and emerging challenges.
The architecture can be outlined in stages, each responsible for a part of the inference
process:
1.

Data Ingestion & Preprocessing:
Raw logs from agent conversations (could be chat transcripts, JSONL files, etc.) are
collected. This includes dialogues of the Advisor with users, and potentially logs of
the prompt-architect agent’s internal reasoning or interactions (if available). The
ingestion system normalizes these logs (unifying format, ensuring all relevant fields
like timestamps, speaker roles, and session IDs are present). Preprocessing then
segments the conversations into meaningful units:
Identify candidate learning fragments using an updated extraction method (for
example, the improved semantic pattern mining or a lightweight classifier to flag
sentences of interest, not just based on fixed verbs). This stage essentially
reproduces and generalizes the step that
created advisor_learning_first_semantics.csv . It should be flexible to agent
type (maybe a slightly different set of patterns for the prompt-architect logs vs
advisor logs, since their content differs).
Attach any available metadata to each fragment: conversation context snippet,
speaker role, turn position, etc., as discussed in Missing Data. The output of this
stage is a structured dataset (let’s call it Enriched Conversation Fragments) that
includes all fragments with metadata and is ready for analysis.

2.

Cognitive Classification & Weighting:
Each extracted fragment is then analyzed to classify its cognitive or functional
category. This corresponds to applying one (or multiple) of the rubric
systems discussed. For example:
Use a trained classifier or rule engine to assign categories like
Reflective/Procedural/Descriptive/Minimal (improved version) or other labels
(dialogue act, Bloom level, etc.). This could output multiple labels or scores per
fragment, creating a high-dimensional profile of the fragment.
Optionally, compute a relevance weight or score for how strongly the fragment
represents a learning moment. The existing weighting model (0.1–0.99) can be
one input, but we could refine it by also considering context (e.g., if a fragment is
central to resolving the task, boost its weight). This could be learned via
regression if we had training data (like which fragments were crucial).

11/14/25, 3:39 PM

Inferring training objectives

Perform role-based tagging: mark whether this fragment pertains to Advisor
behavior, Meta-agent behavior, or both. This might be straightforward since
advisor logs and architect logs might be separate sources. But if in a single
conversation the advisor references what the architect should do (like user says
“architect will use this”), that fragment might be relevant to both roles.
The output is the fragment dataset augmented with labels such as {category
labels, scores, role tag}. Essentially, we mirror
what advisor_learning_weights.csv had but with potentially richer columns
(and for both agent types as applicable).
3.

Pattern Mining & Clustering (Insight Generation):
With classified fragments, the system now seeks higher-level patterns:
Clustering: Using vector representations of fragments (that can encode semantic
meaning beyond the explicit labels), cluster the fragments to see emerging
themes. This might separate out distinct sub-categories of reflections or plans
beyond what the initial classification had. For instance, reflective fragments might
cluster into “understanding-checks” vs “strategy-evaluations”.
Frequent Pattern Extraction: Use algorithms to find common n-grams or
semantic motifs in the fragments. E.g., maybe “I will” starts a lot of high-weight
fragments (indicating the agent planning) or “ensure [X]” is a motif (indicating a
verification step). Identifying these can highlight recurring techniques that should
be formally captured as objectives or best practices.
Outlier Detection: Find fragments that didn’t fit any category well or got very low
weights but intuitively seem important. These might indicate either gaps in the
classification (e.g., a new type of cognitive move not accounted for) or noise.
Outliers should be flagged for human review to decide if a new objective
category is needed or if they are irrelevant.
Trend Analysis: If this system runs continuously over time, it can track if certain
types of fragments are becoming more or less frequent. For example, as the
agent improves, perhaps “clarification questions” become shorter or fewer (if the
user instructions improve). Trends could inform objective emphasis (e.g., if an
important behavior is declining, maybe training needs reinforcement in that
area).
This stage essentially converts raw classified data into insights – groupings and
statistics that suggest what to focus training on. It aligns with the planned “thematic
clustering” and analysis steps in the methodology.

4.

Objective Formulation & Mapping:
Now, the system needs to translate the patterns into actual training objectives. This
involves:

31/34

11/14/25, 3:39 PM

Inferring training objectives

Mapping clusters/categories to objectives: For each identified cluster or
category of fragments, generate a candidate training objective. This could be
templated (e.g., for a cluster identified as “clarify requirement questions”,
generate objective “Agent should practice asking clarifying questions when
requirements are ambiguous”). A knowledge base of objective phrasing (possibly
seeded from learning.json’s style) could be used to help word these consistently.
Some could map directly to existing objectives: e.g., cluster around “lifecycle
management” maps to the known objective about prompt lifecycle. The system
should recognize that and link them (perhaps via keyword match or semantic
similarity to the text of known objectives).
Gap detection (vs existing framework): By linking observed patterns to known
objectives (like those in learning.json or an internal list of current training
objectives), the system can mark which objectives are evidenced in the data and
which are not. If some known objective never appears in any fragment, that
might be flagged as a training gap (maybe the agent isn’t demonstrating that
principle, so it needs more focus or scenario coverage). Conversely, if a strong
cluster emerges that doesn’t match anything in the existing list, that suggests a
new objective proposal. For instance, if advisors consistently do something clever
that wasn’t anticipated, that becomes a new best practice objective.
Ranking or weighting objectives: Not all objectives are equally urgent. The
system can use the fragment weight data or frequency to prioritize. Objectives
backed by many high-weight fragments in the logs are likely core skills (thus high
priority for training). Rarely seen ones might be lower priority or perhaps future
capabilities. We might produce a “heat map” of objectives by how much
supporting evidence exists.
Human-in-the-loop validation: At this formulation stage, it’s wise to involve a
human expert or at least present the draft objectives for review. The architecture
could include an interface where an analyst sees the suggested objectives, along
with example fragments supporting each and stats, and can modify phrasing or
approve/reject additions. This ensures quality control before updating the official
curriculum.
5.

Update Learning Objectives Knowledge Base:
The final list of confirmed or adjusted objectives (with their metadata: which agent
role, linked source evidence, date observed, etc.) is then stored in a Learning
Objectives Repository. This could be an updated learning.json (versioned) or a
database that tracks objectives, their definitions, and their status (new, confirmed, tobe-developed, etc.). The repository might also keep associations: which objectives
map to which training data or scenarios, tying back into the training loop.
If the system architecture is integrated with the training pipeline, these updated
objectives could directly inform curriculum generation or fine-tuning priorities.
For example, if “ask clarification questions” is identified as an objective to
reinforce, the training system might increase the weight of dialogues in finetuning that contain that pattern, or add synthetic training prompts for it.

11/14/25, 3:39 PM

Inferring training objectives

The architecture should support ongoing accumulation: as more conversations
come in, this pipeline runs (perhaps in batches or periodically) and keeps refining
the objectives. It’s an iterative learning process for the development team as
much as for the agent.
6.

Reporting & Monitoring:
The architecture would include a monitoring component that produces reports or
dashboards from the above process. For instance:
A dashboard showing the distribution of fragment types over time (to monitor
changes in agent behavior).
A list of objectives with indicators of evidence (how many times seen, trend
up/down).
Alerts for novel behaviors (new cluster without objective mapping).
Perhaps evaluation metrics if we integrate outcome success: e.g., “Conversations
where Objective X was fulfilled had a 90% success rate.”
These reports help stakeholders understand where the agent’s learning focus
should shift. It also provides transparency (one of the design philosophies
mentioned was transparency) so that one can trace why a certain objective was
added – you can point to the conversation data that justified it.

To give a concrete picture, imagine this architecture in use: The Advisor and Meta-agent
have been deployed in a pilot. After 100 sessions, we run the pipeline. It ingests all chats,
extracts 5000 fragments. Classification finds, say, 300 reflective (mostly advisor), 100
procedural (advisor), 200 procedural (meta-agent logs), 50 new type “creative suggestion”
that wasn't in our original taxonomy. Clustering shows “creative suggestion” is a cluster
(advisor proposing novel ideas, perhaps). The system sees that’s not in the current
objectives list. It proposes a new objective: “Advisor should be able to generate creative
solution ideas when appropriate.” The human reviewer agrees and adds it. Meanwhile, it
matches many meta-agent fragments to the known objective “structured output
validation” from learning.json (since the meta-agent was logging schema validations). It
marks that objective as actively demonstrated. Another objective “context isolation” wasn’t
seen at all – maybe the meta-agent hasn’t encountered that scenario, so it flags it as an
area to test or train further. All this goes into an updated objectives file. The training team
then knows to include some sessions focusing on context isolation, and to commend that
creative suggestions are now part of the advisor’s repertoire to cultivate.
Scalability and Reusability: This architecture is designed to be reusable in that it can
handle new logs with minimal manual adjustment. If new agent roles are introduced in the
future, the classification step might need new patterns, but the pipeline remains similar.
The modular separation (extract -> classify -> cluster -> map to objectives) means
improvements in one module (say a better classifier model) can be integrated without
overhauling the whole system. It’s also scalable: clustering and classification can be done
with big data techniques or cloud services if logs grow large. By automating much of the
insight extraction, it reduces the burden on human experts to comb through transcripts;
they can instead focus on reviewing aggregated insights and making final objective
decisions.

In essence, this system architecture closes the loop between agent performance in the
wild and training program updates. It treats conversation logs as a continual source of
lessons. Over time, this should lead to a virtuous cycle: agents improve, their
conversations reveal higher-level new challenges, those become new training objectives,
which then further improve the agents. This keeps the training objectives dynamic and
evidence-based, ensuring the agents remain aligned with real-world demands and the
evolving blueprint of the AI system.
