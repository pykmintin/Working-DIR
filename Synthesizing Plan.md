# Synthesizer Charter

## Purpose
*Why this synthesizer must exist.*

This synthesizer exists to prevent the loss of insight. When you have 100 branches of thought—transcripts, half-finished projects, evolving ideas—the synthesizer holds them without forcing premature convergence. It is a compression algorithm for your own cognition: store everything, retrieve anything, evolve naturally.

## First Principles
*What must be true for this synthesizer to work.*

1. **Truth lives outside any single conversation.** The synthesizer cannot be queried; it must be referenced. No session holds the synthesizer. The synthesizer is the accumulation of all sessions, externalized and addressable.

2. **Human is the lock.** No action without explicit approval. The synthesizer proposes; you dispose. The moment automation acts without verification, the synthesizer becomes unreliable and you will abandon it.

3. **Messy is raw material.** Friction from messy input is a signal, not a bug. It tells you where the synthesizer's abstraction is too rigid. The synthesizer must adapt to your thought patterns, not reshape them.

4. **Evolution is additive.** New branches grow. Old branches wither naturally when ignored. No forced pruning. The document's health is measured by its ability to accrete without collapsing.

5. **Scale through compression.** A principle can replace a playbook. A pattern can replace a process. The synthesizer must reward abstraction: the more you learn, the less you need to hold.

## Core Tensions
*What paradoxes the charter must hold space for.*

- **Stateless execution vs. cumulative awareness:** How do agents that start fresh benefit from everything learned before?
- **Comfort of known tools vs. pain of their limits:** When does familiarity become a cage? How do you know it's time to leave?
- **Perfectionism vs. progress:** Where is "good enough" defined? Who defines it? What does "best" mean when the map is incomplete?
- **Manual control vs. creative waste:** Which decisions must you keep because they define the work? Which can you gift away because they drain you?

## Objectives
*What done looks like at three horizons.*

**s1**
- Can process one transcript without re-explaining the synthesizer each time.
- Has one place to look for "what have we learned so far."
- Can distinguish between a new thought and a repetition of an old one.

**s2**
- Can see patterns across multiple artifacts without reading them all.
- Can hand a compact packet to a fresh agent and get consistent, useful output.
- Can add a new feedstock (notes, code, plans) without redesigning the synthesizer.

**s3**
- The synthesizer proposes its own evolutions. You only say yes/no.
- The document grows in **depth** (principles) while staying stable in **breadth** (sections).
- You spend less time organizing and more time thinking because the organization is automatic.

## Open Questions (The Living Edge)
*Where new branches attach. This is the most important section.*

- What is "synthesizer awareness" made of? Patterns? Projects? Principles? All three?
- What triggers an "evolution" of the charter itself?
- How do you measure "getting smarter"? Time saved? Insights gained? Your subjective clarity?
- What is the smallest unit of thought that deserves its own branch?
- When does a branch deserve to be marked "inactive"?
- What does "done" mean for a transcript? For a project? For the synthesizer itself?

## Evolution Covenant
*How this document changes without breaking.*

- **Revision Trigger:** Whenever you feel "I've been solving the wrong problem."
- **Revision Process:** Add new sections at the bottom. Never delete old ones. Mark them "inactive" if they wither. The document's history is as important as its current state.
- **Sign of Health:** The length of "Open Questions" grows shorter as principles migrate upward. The document becomes more *certain* without becoming more *complex*.
