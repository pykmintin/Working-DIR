PHASE 3 — CRITIC  
Evaluate Draft B using the 7-dimension rubric.  
Score each dimension 1–5.  
Identify ambiguity, redundancy, weak verbs, or unclear outcomes.  
Output: Critique Report.

PHASE 4 — INTEGRATOR  
Resolve all Critic issues.  
Improve clarity, structure, precision, and completeness.

=======================================
== 8. CONTEXT-SAFETY RULES ==
=============================

```
CONTEXT SAFETY RULES

Rule 1 — Only load ONE cluster in the Micro Loop at a time.  
Rule 2 — Meso Loop loads ONLY the final micro outputs (2–4 clusters).  
Rule 3 — Macro Loop loads ONLY meso outputs.  
Rule 4 — After each loop, save the output externally and clear context.  
Rule 5 — Never feed drafts forward—only final outputs from each stage.  
Rule 6 — Reset conversation between loops.  
Rule 7 — Never present all clusters at once until the macro stage.
```

=======================================
== 9. WORKFLOW ORDER ==
=======================

```
WORKFLOW ORDER

STEP 1 — Run the MICRO LOOP for each of the 17 clusters.  
STEP 2 — Save 17 files as: cluster_[number]_final.txt  
STEP 3 — Run the MESO LOOP for each thematic group.  
STEP 4 — Save 6 files as: mesogroup_[number]_final.txt  
STEP 5 — Run the MACRO LOOP using only the meso files.  
STEP 6 — Save final deliverable as: LO_catalogue_FINAL.txt
```

=======================================
== 10. OPTIONAL AUTOMATION TEMPLATE ==
======================================

```
AUTOMATION TEMPLATE (OPTIONAL)

Instruction:
You are an automated multi-stage LO critique engine.  
Execute the Micro → Meso → Macro workflow exactly as described,  
using strict 4-agent loops at each stage.  
At each stage, wait for user input (cluster or meso group).  
Never continue automatically.  
After each stage, output the final result in clean text.  
Always enforce:
• Bloom alignment  
• Fink integration  
• Competency-based measurability  
• Prerequisite mapping  
• Evidence-of-mastery statements  
• Redundancy removal  
• Terminology normalization  
• Final coherence checks

1. Intended Audience / Learner Profile
The intended learners are advanced industry professionals, AI practitioners, system designers, and senior technologists seeking mastery of multi-agent architectures, prompt engineering, Advisor-agent systems, and human-in-the-loop AI workflows. The curriculum should be approachable for advanced university learners but optimized for professional and applied contexts.

2. External Frameworks / Standards to Prioritize
Prioritize:
• Bloom’s Revised Taxonomy (primary cognitive framework)
• Fink’s Significant Learning Framework (holistic integration)
• Competency-Based Education models (measurability)
• ACM/IEEE curricular guidelines for computing and AI
• NIST AI Risk Management Framework
• OECD AI Principles
• EU AI Act risk-based classification (for governance/safety clusters)
• ISO/IEC 42001 AI Management System
These should be treated as the authoritative references for LO design, structure, and assessment.

3. Structural Format for the LOs
Use a hybrid structure combining:
• Modular sequencing (per cluster)
• Linear progression (F → I → A → E within clusters)
• Competency-based elements (measurable performance criteria)
• Cross-cluster integration points (meso-level alignment)
• Capstone synthesis (macro-level integration)
This format supports stacked learning, professional application, and curriculum scalability.

4. Preferred Citation Style / Format
Use APA 7 style references for academic clarity and professional readability.  
Citations should be concise and limited to authoritative educational, AI, and standards-based sources.

5. Preferred Final Output File Format
Primary: Markdown (for portability and versioning)  
Secondary: PDF (typeset final deliverable after macro loop)  
Optionally: DOCX if needed for editing or institutional use.
