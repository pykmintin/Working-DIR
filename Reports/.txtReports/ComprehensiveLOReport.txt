# Comprehensive Learning Objective Catalogue for Advanced AI System Design

## 1. Foundational Frameworks for Learning Objective Design

### 1.1. Core Instructional Design Frameworks

The development of a rigorous and comprehensive curriculum for advanced AI system design necessitates a structured approach grounded in established instructional design theories. This section outlines the primary frameworks selected to guide the creation of learning objectives (LOs) for this specialized field. The chosen frameworks—Bloom's Revised Taxonomy, Fink's Significant Learning Taxonomy, and Competency-Based Education (CBE) models—provide a multi-faceted lens for defining, sequencing, and assessing learning outcomes. These frameworks were selected for their proven efficacy in higher education and professional training, their ability to address both cognitive and affective learning domains, and their alignment with modern pedagogical principles that emphasize measurable, observable, and professionally relevant skills. By integrating these models, the curriculum is designed to ensure a holistic learning experience that builds foundational knowledge, fosters practical application, and cultivates the critical thinking and ethical considerations essential for designing and managing complex AI systems. The subsequent sections will detail the specific contributions of each framework and their synergistic application in the context of AI education.

#### 1.1.1. Bloom's Revised Taxonomy as the Primary Cognitive Framework

Bloom's Revised Taxonomy serves as the foundational cognitive framework for structuring the learning objectives within this curriculum. Originally developed by Benjamin Bloom in 1956 and later revised by Anderson and Krathwohl in 2001, this taxonomy provides a hierarchical model for classifying educational goals based on the cognitive processes they involve . The revised version, which is prioritized here, rephrases the original six levels as verbs to emphasize active learning and uses action words to describe the cognitive processes students should engage in. The six levels, in ascending order of complexity, are: **Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create** . This hierarchical structure is crucial for designing a curriculum that ensures a logical progression of learning, where mastery of lower-level skills (e.g., remembering facts) is a prerequisite for achieving higher-order thinking (e.g., creating new solutions). For an advanced AI curriculum, this framework is particularly valuable as it allows for the precise articulation of cognitive demands, from recalling the definitions of key AI concepts (Remember) to designing novel multi-agent architectures (Create). The use of specific, observable action verbs associated with each level, such as "define," "explain," "apply," "analyze," "evaluate," and "design," ensures that learning objectives are clear, measurable, and directly aligned with assessment strategies . This structured approach facilitates the design of learning experiences that systematically build intellectual skills and problem-solving capabilities, which are paramount in the field of AI system design.

The application of Bloom's Revised Taxonomy extends beyond simple classification; it provides a robust framework for designing assessments and learning activities that are directly aligned with the intended cognitive outcomes. For instance, a learning objective at the "Apply" level might require students to use a specific algorithm to solve a problem in a new context, while an "Evaluate" level objective would ask them to critique the effectiveness of that same algorithm based on predefined criteria . This distinction is critical in an AI curriculum, where the ability to not only use tools but also to critically assess their performance, limitations, and ethical implications is a core competency. The taxonomy also supports the integration of different types of knowledge—factual, conceptual, procedural, and metacognitive—into the learning objectives, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter . By systematically progressing through the taxonomy's levels, the curriculum can guide learners from foundational knowledge to the sophisticated analytical and creative skills required to tackle complex, real-world AI challenges. This structured progression is essential for developing professionals who can not only operate existing AI systems but also innovate and lead in the development of next-generation technologies. The clear, hierarchical nature of Bloom's Revised Taxonomy makes it an indispensable tool for ensuring the rigor, coherence, and effectiveness of the proposed AI system design curriculum.

#### 1.1.2. Fink's Significant Learning Framework for Holistic Integration

While Bloom's Revised Taxonomy provides a robust structure for cognitive development, Dee Fink's Taxonomy of Significant Learning offers a more holistic and integrated approach to curriculum design. Fink's framework is non-hierarchical and emphasizes the interconnectedness of different learning domains, aiming to create a lasting impact on the learner that extends beyond the classroom . It is composed of six categories: **Foundational Knowledge, Application, Integration, Human Dimension, Caring, and Learning How to Learn** . This framework is particularly well-suited for an advanced AI curriculum because it explicitly incorporates dimensions that are critical for responsible and effective AI development, such as the "Human Dimension" (learning about oneself and others) and "Caring" (developing new feelings, interests, and values) . These categories address the ethical, social, and personal aspects of working with AI, which are often overlooked in purely cognitive models. For example, the "Human Dimension" encourages learners to consider how AI systems impact individuals and society, while "Caring" fosters a sense of responsibility and a commitment to ethical practices . By integrating these dimensions, the curriculum can cultivate not only skilled technicians but also thoughtful and responsible innovators who are prepared to navigate the complex socio-technical landscape of AI.

The non-hierarchical nature of Fink's taxonomy allows for a more flexible and dynamic approach to curriculum design, where learning in one category can stimulate and reinforce learning in others . For instance, as students learn about the societal impact of AI (Human Dimension), they may develop a deeper appreciation for the importance of ethical design (Caring), which in turn can motivate them to engage more deeply with the technical content (Foundational Knowledge and Application). This interactive and synergistic approach to learning is essential for developing the kind of deep, transferable understanding that is required for expert-level AI system design. Furthermore, Fink's framework provides a rich set of action verbs that are specifically tailored to each of the six categories, enabling the creation of learning objectives that are both specific and comprehensive . For example, verbs like "collaborate," "empathize," and "advocate" are used for the "Human Dimension," while "commit," "value," and "defend" are used for "Caring" . This allows for the precise articulation of learning outcomes that go beyond the cognitive domain to encompass the development of interpersonal skills, ethical values, and a lifelong learning mindset. By incorporating Fink's Significant Learning framework, the curriculum can ensure that it is not only teaching students *what* to do with AI, but also *how* to think about it and *why* it matters, thereby fostering a more complete and impactful learning experience.

#### 1.1.3. Competency-Based Education (CBE) Models for Measurability

Competency-Based Education (CBE) models provide the third pillar of this learning objective catalogue, ensuring that all learning outcomes are not only well-defined but also directly tied to measurable, real-world competencies. Unlike traditional education models that often focus on seat time or the completion of a set curriculum, CBE is centered on the demonstration of mastery of specific skills and knowledge . This approach is particularly relevant for a professional and applied field like AI system design, where the ultimate goal is to produce practitioners who can effectively and ethically build and deploy AI solutions. A key characteristic of CBE is its focus on outcomes; learning objectives are defined in terms of what learners can *do* upon completion of a module or course, and assessments are designed to measure the application of these competencies in authentic contexts . This ensures a high degree of alignment between the curriculum and the actual demands of the industry. Furthermore, CBE models often allow for flexible pacing, enabling learners to progress as soon as they have demonstrated mastery of a competency, which can lead to more efficient and effective learning. The emphasis on practical application and demonstrable skills makes CBE an essential framework for ensuring that this curriculum produces graduates who are ready to make an immediate and meaningful impact in their professional roles.

The application of CBE principles within this catalogue means that each learning objective is framed as a specific, measurable competency. For example, instead of a vague objective like "understand prompt engineering," a CBE-aligned objective would be "design and implement a multi-layered prompt architecture to guide a large language model in generating a complex, structured report, demonstrating an ability to decompose tasks, manage context, and ensure output quality." This objective is specific, measurable, and focused on a real-world application. The curriculum is structured around a series of such competencies, organized into the four levels of Foundational, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert/Architect. At each level, learners are required to demonstrate their mastery of the competencies through a variety of assessments, such as projects, case studies, and practical exercises. For instance, a Foundational-level competency might involve "identifying and explaining the key components of a human-in-the-loop system," while an Expert-level competency might be "designing and deploying a human-in-the-loop workflow for a high-stakes AI application, incorporating mechanisms for feedback, oversight, and continuous improvement." This focus on demonstrable skills ensures that the learning process is not just about acquiring theoretical knowledge but about developing the practical expertise needed to excel in the field of AI. The integration of CBE models also aligns with the broader goals of workforce development, as it ensures that the skills taught are directly relevant to the needs of the industry and that graduates are well-prepared for the challenges and opportunities of the AI era .

### 1.2. Alignment with Professional and Academic Standards

To ensure the highest level of rigor, relevance, and credibility, this learning objective catalogue is explicitly aligned with a set of authoritative professional and academic standards. These standards, developed by leading organizations in the fields of computing, AI, and risk management, provide a benchmark for the knowledge, skills, and ethical considerations that are essential for professionals in this domain. By grounding the curriculum in these widely recognized frameworks, we ensure that the learning objectives are not only pedagogically sound but also reflect the current best practices and future direction of the AI industry. This alignment serves multiple purposes: it enhances the portability and recognition of the credentials earned by learners, it provides a clear pathway for professional development, and it ensures that the curriculum remains current and responsive to the evolving landscape of AI technology and regulation. The standards selected for this alignment include the ACM/IEEE curricular guidelines for computing and AI, the NIST AI Risk Management Framework, the OECD AI Principles, the EU AI Act, and the ISO/IEC 42001 AI Management System. Each of these frameworks contributes a unique perspective, from technical foundations and pedagogical approaches to ethical principles and regulatory requirements, creating a comprehensive and robust foundation for the curriculum.

#### 1.2.1. ACM/IEEE Curricular Guidelines for Computing and AI

The ACM/IEEE curricular guidelines for computing and AI serve as a foundational reference for the technical and conceptual content of this learning objective catalogue. These guidelines, developed by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the IEEE Computer Society, represent a global consensus on the essential knowledge and skills required for a comprehensive education in computing and AI. By aligning with these guidelines, we ensure that the curriculum covers the core concepts and principles that are fundamental to the field, providing learners with a solid and well-rounded technical foundation. The guidelines are structured around a set of knowledge areas, such as algorithms, data structures, software engineering, and artificial intelligence, each with a detailed set of learning outcomes. This structure provides a clear and comprehensive roadmap for curriculum design, ensuring that all essential topics are covered in a logical and progressive manner. The alignment with these guidelines also ensures that the curriculum is consistent with the standards of leading academic institutions around the world, enhancing the credibility and portability of the credentials earned by learners. Furthermore, the guidelines are regularly updated to reflect the latest developments in the field, ensuring that the curriculum remains current and relevant in the face of rapid technological change.

In the context of this specific catalogue, the ACM/IEEE guidelines inform the design of learning objectives across all 17 clusters, from the foundational principles of human-centered AI to the advanced topics of multi-agent systems and governance. For example, the guidelines on software engineering provide a framework for the learning objectives related to system architecture, state management, and evaluation metrics, ensuring that learners understand the principles of designing robust, scalable, and maintainable AI systems. Similarly, the guidelines on artificial intelligence inform the objectives related to prompt engineering, knowledge management, and long-context engineering, ensuring that learners have a deep understanding of the underlying algorithms and techniques. The alignment with these guidelines also extends to the pedagogical approach, with an emphasis on active learning, problem-solving, and hands-on experience. This ensures that learners are not just passively absorbing information but are actively engaged in the process of building and applying their knowledge, developing the practical skills and critical thinking abilities that are essential for success in the field of AI. By grounding the curriculum in these authoritative guidelines, we ensure that it provides a rigorous, comprehensive, and industry-relevant education in advanced AI system design.

#### 1.2.2. NIST AI Risk Management Framework

The NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) is a critical component of the alignment strategy for this learning objective catalogue, providing a structured and comprehensive approach to managing the risks associated with AI systems. Developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the AI RMF is a voluntary framework that provides a common language and a set of best practices for identifying, assessing, and mitigating AI risks. By integrating the principles and practices of the AI RMF into the curriculum, we ensure that learners are not only equipped with the technical skills to build AI systems but also with the knowledge and tools to do so in a responsible and trustworthy manner. The framework is organized around four key functions: **Govern, Map, Measure, and Manage**. These functions provide a systematic process for addressing AI risks throughout the entire lifecycle of an AI system, from design and development to deployment and monitoring. The "Govern" function emphasizes the importance of establishing a culture of risk management within an organization, while the "Map" function focuses on identifying and contextualizing AI risks. The "Measure" function provides guidance on developing and implementing methods for assessing and monitoring AI risks, and the "Manage" function outlines strategies for allocating risk resources and mitigating identified risks.

The integration of the NIST AI RMF into this learning objective catalogue is particularly evident in the clusters related to governance, safety, and evaluation. For example, the learning objectives for **Cluster 15: Governance, Safety Boundaries & AI Anti-Goals** are directly informed by the principles of the AI RMF. Learners will be expected to understand the core concepts of the framework, including the different categories of AI risk (such as harmful bias, lack of transparency, and security vulnerabilities) and the various methods for assessing and mitigating these risks. They will also learn how to apply the framework's four functions to real-world AI systems, developing the skills to create and implement a comprehensive risk management plan. Similarly, the learning objectives for **Cluster 14: Evaluation Metrics, Quality Assurance & Drift Detection** are aligned with the "Measure" function of the AI RMF, emphasizing the importance of developing robust and reliable methods for evaluating the performance and trustworthiness of AI systems. By incorporating the NIST AI RMF into the curriculum, we ensure that learners are prepared to navigate the complex and evolving landscape of AI risk management, developing the expertise to build AI systems that are not only effective and efficient but also safe, fair, and trustworthy.

#### 1.2.3. OECD AI Principles and EU AI Act Risk-Based Classification

The alignment of this learning objective catalogue with the OECD AI Principles and the EU AI Act's risk-based classification system is essential for preparing learners to develop and deploy AI systems in a manner that is ethical, legal, and aligned with international standards. The OECD AI Principles, adopted by the OECD and G20, provide a set of high-level values and recommendations for the responsible stewardship of trustworthy AI. These principles include **human-centered values, fairness, transparency, explainability, robustness, security, and accountability**. By integrating these principles into the curriculum, we ensure that learners develop a strong ethical foundation and a deep understanding of the societal implications of AI. The learning objectives will challenge learners to not only understand these principles in theory but also to apply them in practice, designing and evaluating AI systems through an ethical lens. This focus on ethical considerations is woven throughout the curriculum, from the foundational concepts of human-centered AI to the advanced topics of governance and safety. For example, learners will be asked to analyze case studies of AI systems that have had unintended negative consequences, identify the ethical principles that were violated, and propose alternative designs that would have mitigated these risks.

The EU AI Act, the world's first comprehensive AI regulation, provides a more concrete and legally binding framework for the development and deployment of AI systems. The Act adopts a risk-based approach, classifying AI systems into four categories: **unacceptable risk (which are prohibited), high-risk (which are subject to strict requirements), limited risk (which are subject to transparency obligations), and minimal risk (which are largely unregulated)** . The learning objectives in this catalogue are designed to provide learners with a thorough understanding of this risk-based classification system and the specific requirements that apply to each category. For example, learners will learn about the legal obligations for providers and deployers of high-risk AI systems, including the requirements for data quality, technical documentation, human oversight, and conformity assessments. They will also learn about the prohibited AI practices, such as social scoring and the use of subliminal techniques, and the transparency obligations for limited-risk AI systems, such as chatbots and deepfakes. By aligning with the EU AI Act, we ensure that learners are prepared to navigate the complex and evolving regulatory landscape of AI, developing the expertise to build and deploy AI systems that are not only technically sound and ethically responsible but also legally compliant. This alignment is particularly crucial for the clusters related to governance, safety, and human-in-the-loop design, where the legal and ethical implications of AI are most prominent.

#### 1.2.4. ISO/IEC 42001 AI Management System

The ISO/IEC 42001 standard for Artificial Intelligence Management Systems (AIMS) provides a crucial framework for aligning the curriculum with the practical requirements of establishing, implementing, and maintaining effective AI governance within an organization. This standard is designed to be compatible with other management system standards, such as ISO/IEC 27001 for information security, allowing for an integrated approach to governance, risk, and compliance . The core of ISO/IEC 42001 is a set of requirements for an AIMS, which is a framework of policies, processes, and procedures for managing AI-related risks and opportunities. The standard is structured around the **Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle** and includes clauses on context, leadership, planning, support, operation, performance evaluation, and improvement . By aligning the curriculum with ISO/IEC 42001, we can ensure that learners develop a practical understanding of how to build and operate a comprehensive AI management system, from defining the organization's AI policy and objectives to conducting risk assessments, implementing controls, and monitoring performance. This is essential for preparing students to take on leadership roles in AI governance and to contribute to the development of a mature and responsible AI ecosystem within their organizations.

The alignment with ISO/IEC 42001 is particularly relevant for the advanced and expert-level learning objectives in the curriculum. For example, students at these levels will be expected to design and implement an AIMS for a hypothetical or real-world organization, taking into account its specific context, risk appetite, and regulatory requirements. This will involve developing a deep understanding of the standard's requirements, such as the need for leadership commitment, stakeholder engagement, and a systematic approach to risk management . The curriculum will also cover the specific controls and measures that are recommended by the standard, such as those related to data quality, model validation, bias mitigation, explainability, and human oversight . By engaging with the practical requirements of ISO/IEC 42001, students will not only gain a theoretical understanding of AI governance but also develop the hands-on skills needed to apply this knowledge in a professional setting. This alignment with a leading international standard ensures that the curriculum is not only academically rigorous but also highly relevant to the needs of the industry, preparing graduates to lead the way in building trustworthy and well-governed AI systems.

### 1.3. Structure and Components of a Learning Objective

The structure and components of a learning objective are critical to its effectiveness in guiding instruction and assessment. A well-written learning objective is clear, concise, and measurable, providing a clear statement of what learners are expected to know or be able to do as a result of a learning experience. To ensure consistency and rigor in the development of this learning objective catalogue, we have adopted a hybrid structure that combines the best practices from several established frameworks. This structure is designed to be both comprehensive and flexible, allowing for the creation of learning objectives that are tailored to the specific needs of each cluster and level of proficiency. The key components of this structure include the ABCD framework, the SMART criteria, and a clear alignment between the learning objective, the cognitive level, and the evidence of mastery. By adhering to this structured approach, we can ensure that all learning objectives in this catalogue are of the highest quality, providing a solid foundation for the design of effective and engaging learning experiences.

#### 1.3.1. The ABCD Framework: Audience, Behavior, Condition, Degree

The ABCD framework is a widely used model for writing clear and effective learning objectives. The framework consists of four key components: **Audience, Behavior, Condition, and Degree**. The **Audience** component specifies who the learners are, such as "students," "participants," or "engineers." The **Behavior** component is the most critical part of the objective, as it describes the specific, observable action that the learner is expected to perform. This behavior should be described using a strong action verb, such as "design," "analyze," or "evaluate," that is aligned with the desired cognitive level. The **Condition** component describes the circumstances under which the behavior is to be performed, such as "given a set of data," "using a specific software tool," or "in a team setting." The **Degree** component specifies the standard of performance that is expected, such as "with 90% accuracy," "within a 30-minute time limit," or "to the satisfaction of the instructor." By including all four of these components, a learning objective can be made highly specific and measurable, leaving no room for ambiguity about what is expected of the learner.

In the context of this learning objective catalogue, the ABCD framework is used to structure all learning objectives, ensuring that they are clear, concise, and actionable. For example, a learning objective for the Foundational level of Cluster 1 might be: "Upon completion of this module, **(Audience)** students will be able to **(Behavior)** identify and explain the five core principles of human-centered AI, **(Condition)** given a case study of an AI system, **(Degree)** with 100% accuracy." This objective clearly specifies who is expected to learn (students), what they are expected to do (identify and explain), the context in which they will do it (given a case study), and the standard of performance required (100% accuracy). By using the ABCD framework to structure all learning objectives in this catalogue, we can ensure that they are well-defined, measurable, and aligned with the principles of effective instructional design. This structured approach also facilitates the development of assessments that are directly aligned with the learning objectives, as the observable behavior described in the objective can be directly measured through various assessment methods.

#### 1.3.2. The SMART Criteria: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound

The SMART criteria provide a set of guidelines for ensuring that learning objectives are well-defined and effective. The acronym SMART stands for **Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound**. The **Specific** criterion requires that the learning objective be clear and unambiguous, leaving no room for interpretation. The **Measurable** criterion requires that the learning objective be stated in terms of observable behaviors that can be assessed. The **Achievable** criterion requires that the learning objective be realistic and attainable for the target audience, given their prior knowledge and skills. The **Relevant** criterion requires that the learning objective be aligned with the overall goals of the curriculum and the needs of the learners. The **Time-bound** criterion requires that the learning objective specify a timeframe for its completion. By applying the SMART criteria to the development of learning objectives, we can ensure that they are well-designed and that they provide a clear and effective guide for instruction and assessment.

In the context of this learning objective catalogue, the SMART criteria are used to evaluate and refine the learning objectives to ensure that they meet the highest standards of quality. For example, the learning objective "Students will understand the principles of prompt engineering" is not specific or measurable. A SMART version of this objective might be: "By the end of this module, students will be able to design and implement a multi-layered prompt architecture for a large language model that generates a structured report, demonstrating an ability to decompose tasks, manage context, and ensure output quality." This objective is specific (design and implement a multi-layered prompt architecture), measurable (the resulting report and the design process), achievable (for an advanced audience), relevant (to the topic of prompt engineering), and time-bound (by the end of this module). By using the SMART criteria to guide the development of learning objectives, we can ensure that they are clear, concise, and effective, providing a solid foundation for the design of a high-quality curriculum.

#### 1.3.3. Aligning Evidence of Mastery with Cognitive Levels

A critical aspect of designing effective learning objectives is ensuring that the "Evidence of Mastery," or the assessment method used to evaluate learner performance, is directly aligned with the cognitive level of the objective itself. This principle of alignment ensures that the assessment accurately measures the intended learning outcome and provides a valid indication of whether learners have achieved the desired level of mastery. A misalignment between the learning objective and the assessment can lead to inaccurate and misleading results, as it may not be measuring the intended cognitive skill. For example, if a learning objective requires learners to "evaluate" the effectiveness of a particular AI algorithm, but the assessment only consists of a multiple-choice quiz that tests factual recall, then the assessment is not aligned with the objective . In this case, the assessment is measuring a lower-level cognitive skill (remembering) than what is required by the objective (evaluating), and therefore, it cannot provide a valid measure of whether learners have achieved the intended outcome.

To ensure proper alignment, the assessment method must be carefully selected to match the cognitive process specified in the learning objective. For objectives at the lower levels of Bloom's Taxonomy, such as "remembering" and "understanding," assessments might include quizzes, tests, or short-answer questions that require learners to recall or explain information. As the cognitive level increases, the assessment methods should become more complex and performance-based. For example, to assess an objective that requires learners to "apply" their knowledge, a case study or a hands-on lab exercise might be appropriate. For objectives at the higher levels of the taxonomy, such as "analyzing," "evaluating," and "creating," assessments should require learners to engage in more complex and open-ended tasks. These might include research papers, project-based assignments, or presentations that require learners to demonstrate their ability to think critically, solve problems, and generate new ideas. By carefully aligning the assessment method with the cognitive level of the learning objective, the curriculum ensures that it is providing a fair, accurate, and meaningful evaluation of learner performance, which is essential for both learner success and the overall effectiveness of the educational program .

## 2. Learning Objectives for Human-Centered AI and System Design

### 2.1. Cluster 1: Human-Centered AI Foundations & Human-in-the-Loop Design

This cluster introduces the foundational principles of Human-Centered AI (HCAI), emphasizing the design of AI systems that augment and empower human capabilities rather than replace them.

Learners will explore different architectural patterns for advisor agents, including modular designs, microservices, and event-driven architectures. They will also learn how to design behavior protocols that govern the interaction between the advisor agent and the human user, ensuring that the agent's behavior is predictable, reliable, and aligned with the principles of the Advisor Philosophy. The cluster will also address the critical issue of defining decision boundaries, which involves specifying the types of decisions that the agent is authorized to make autonomously and those that require human approval. By the end of this cluster, learners will be able to design and implement robust and scalable advisor agent systems that are both technically sophisticated and ethically sound.

#### 2.3.1. Foundational Level Objectives
