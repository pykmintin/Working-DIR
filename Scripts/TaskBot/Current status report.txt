**FACTUAL STATE REPORT**

---

**INFRASTRUCTURE STATUS**

- **Fly.io**: App "taskbot" deployed and operational. Secrets configured: DISCORD_TOKEN, GITHUB_TOKEN, AUTHORIZED_USER=367581971053805568, GITHUB_REPO=pykmintin/Repo
- **GitHub**: Repo `pykmintin/Repo` contains `tasks.json` with 24 tasks (confirmed by user posting live task list)
- **Discord Bot**: Online in user's private channel, responds only to authorized user. Bot ID and OAuth2 status functional.
- **Local Files**: Complete set exists at `C:\Users\JoshMain\Documents\Working-DIR\Taskbot`: bot.py, fly.toml, requirements.txt, Dockerfile

---

**CURRENT BOT BEHAVIOR**

- `!add h/n Task` syntax works and writes to GitHub
- `!tasks` displays block list with IDs, priorities (🔴/⚪), status (⏳/✅)
- Task list correctly shows 24 tasks: 8 high priority undone, 13 normal undone, 3 completed
- Authorization functional: bot ignores all users except 367581971053805568
- Reacting ✅ to any bot message completes "first undone task" (user explicitly stated this is unwanted behavior)

---

**USER'S STATED OBJECTIVES**

From direct quotes and paraphrased statements:
- "I want to talk to the Discord bot like an AI assistant" (natural language, no rigid syntax memorization)
- "The reaction thing is completely crappy" (must be removed entirely)
- "I want to manage tasks by ID number" (explicit ID references for all operations)
- "Multiple commands per message" (e.g., execute several commands in one Discord message)
- "Smarter script" (automatic date/time parsing, priority detection from language)
- "Integrate with Google calendar" (manual, on-demand export of specific tasks to Google, not automatic sync)
- "I don't want to memorize syntax" (single-user channel, bot should assume all messages are directed to it)
- "I want to say 'dentist tomorrow high' and it just works"
- "GitHub is the master list, Google is secondary" (GitHub remains primary storage, Google is optional export target)

---

**UNDEFINED PARAMETERS**

These have not been specified by user and remain open questions:
- Discord Developer Portal: Current status of Gateway Intents (Presence, Server Members, Message Content)
- Multi-command delimiter: How should bot separate multiple commands in one message?
- Natural language parsing: Strictness level, specific date formats to support, priority keywords
- Google export scope: Calendar events, Tasks, or both? Select by ID range, list, priority?
- Task list architecture: Single list or multiple named lists?
- Failure mode handling: What happens when Google auth expires? Silent failure or explicit message?
